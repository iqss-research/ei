Authors: Gary King, Margaret Roberts

aggregate data. It implements the statistical procedures, diagnostics,
and graphics from the book [A Solution to the Ecological Inference
Problem: Reconstructing Individual Behavior from Aggregate
Data](https://gking.harvard.edu/eicamera/kinroot.html) (Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1997), by Gary King.
