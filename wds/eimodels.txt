Note on eimodels_ave() proc

Right now, eimodels_ave() allows users to use different t, and x for
each model though it warns them by issuing a warning. If users use
different n, the program won't run.  However, it only stores the
values of t and x from the first model even when users use different t
and x. This affects some of eiread() calculation - not the parameters
stored in the output buffer such as betabs, betaws, aggs, postprob,
etc. In the future we might want to modify eimodels_ave() such that it
stores all the different t and x. Then, we also need to adjust
eiread() to compute appropriate parameter values using different t and
x.
