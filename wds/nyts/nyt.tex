\begin{abstract}
  Although not widely known until much later, Al Gore received 202
  more votes than George W.\ Bush on election day in Florida.  George
  W.\ Bush is president because he overcame his election day deficit
  with overseas absentee ballots that arrived and were counted after
  election day.  In the final official tally, Bush received 537 more
  votes than Gore.  These numbers are taken from the official results
  released by the Florida Secretary of State's office and so do not
  reflect overvotes, undervotes, unsuccessful litigation, butterfly
  ballot problems, recounts that might have been allowed but were not,
  or any other hypothetical divergence between voter preferences and
  counted votes.  After the election, \emph{The New York Times}
  conducted a six month investigation and found that 680 of the
  overseas absentee ballots were illegally counted, and almost no one
  has publicly disagreed with their assessment.  In this paper, we
  describe the statistical procedures we developed and implemented for
  the \emph{Times} to ascertain whether disqualifying these 680
  ballots would have changed the outcome of the election.  We present
  a variety of new empirical results that delineate the precise
  conditions under which Al Gore would have been elected president,
  and offer new evidence of the striking effectiveness of the
  Republican effort to prevent local election officials from applying
  election law equally to all Florida citizens.

\section{Introduction}

Many aspects of the 2000 election were the subject of considerable
media attention, litigation, and academic analysis in the uncertain
month that followed the voting.
% \footnote{The 2000 election produced
%   literally dozens of papers, many written within days of the election
%   and posted on the web.  For links to many on this growing list, see
%   \url{http://www.polsci.wvu.edu/PolyCy/psrecount.html}.}
In contrast, Florida's overseas absentee ballots were spared most of
this attention and all litigation.  Yet, they determined the election
outcome: If only the votes cast on election day were counted, Al Gore
would have beat George W.\ Bush by 202 votes and become president.
According to official results from the State of Florida, it took the
overseas absentee ballots for Bush to outdistance Gore, which he did
in the end by 537 votes (see Table \ref{tb:official}).  The extent to
which the law was followed in this small but consequential part of the
story escaped scrutiny for some time. After the election was
certified, however, \emph{The New York Times} conducted a six month
investigation during which they retrieved the envelopes in which the
ballots were mailed, and searched for violations of the law (Barstow
and Van Natta, Jr., 2001).  In one of the longest set of articles ever
published by \emph{The Times}, they concluded that 680 of the overseas
absentee ballots that had been counted by Florida counties
unambiguously violated one or more aspects of Florida election law
and, by any reasonable interpretation of the law, should have been
discarded.  Indeed, after \emph{The Times} story appeared,
commentators and partisans from both sides accepted these factual
claims.\footnote{The only exception seems to have been Zelnick
  (2001)\nocite{Zelnick01}.}

\end{table} 

In comparison with other features of the election that have been
studied, this problem was not caused by old machines or the
inattention of local election officials.  It also does not rely on
somehow inferring the intent of the voters.  Rather, according to
\emph{The Times}, the overseas ballot problem was due to blatantly
illegal actions on the part of local election officials, encouraged by
Republicans, that had not been previously noticed.  \emph{The Times}
argued that local officials were influenced by the deliberate
political strategies employed by the Bush campaign, and comparative
neglect by the Democrats.\footnote{The Democrats had planned to
  contest the absentee ballots, but Democratic Vice Presidential
  Candidate Joe Lieberman on Meet the Press ended this strategy when
  he explained that he ``would give the benefit of the doubt to
  ballots coming in from military personnel generally.\ldots Al Gore
  and I don't want to ever be part of anything that would put an extra
  burden on the military personnel abroad who want to vote.''  Gore
  backed him up and left the Republican strategy unchallenged.  See
  Berke (2001).}  They concluded that ``Under intense pressure from
the Republicans, Florida officials accepted hundreds of overseas
absentee ballots that failed to comply with the state laws'' (Barstow
and Van Natta, Jr., 2001)\nocite{BarVan01}.

Were these 680 inappropriately counted ballots enough to have thrown
the election to the wrong candidate?  \emph{The Times} hired us to
find out.  Our conclusions were presented as part of the story
(Barstow and Van Natta, Jr., 2001) and our methods were briefly
described in a sidebar (Barbanel, 2001)\nocite{Barbanel01}.  In this
paper, we discuss in detail the methods we developed for this project
so that others might use them for similar problems.  The situation
calls for ecological inference: We observe the number of bad ballots
in each of Florida's counties and the number of ballots cast and
counted for each of the candidates.  From these variables, and a
variety of other auxiliary information, we try to infer the total
number of bad ballots that had been cast for each candidate and see
whether this is enough to make up for Bush's official 537 vote margin.

Since the partisan atmosphere surrounding public discourse on this
issue was so highly charged, we knew that our work would be subject to
more than the usual academic scrutiny, and so we sought out methods
that were less vulnerable to partisan criticism.  We therefore used
three separate approaches --- inference with no statistical
assumptions, with a succession of single models, and with Bayesian
model averaging that enable us to average over all models that any
partisan might have considered weighted according to their relative
probability of being correct, as indicated by the data.  So that
others can use the methods we introduce here to analyze other
problems, we have included all methods introduced here in the program
\emph{EI: A Program for Ecological Inference}.

We estimate the probability that Gore would have won the election if
the law had been followed in this instance.  This probability is
small, but we show that with mathematical certainty it is greater than
zero.  Secondly, although our results suggest that it is unlikely
that illegal overseas absentee ballots alone changed the election
outcome, we show that Bush's margin of victory would likely have been
much narrower if those flawed ballots had not been counted.  This
supports the argument made by \emph{The Times} that the flawed ballots
favored Bush much more than Gore.  We also present a variety of
results that did not appear in \emph{The Times} article, including the
probability that Gore would have won under various hypothetical
scenarios, such as if Katherine Harris had accepted Palm Beach
County's recount, which was submitted two hours late.  In some
plausible scenarios, the probability that Gore would have won is
nearly 100\%.  Finally, and perhaps most interesting, we present
evidence that the propensity of local election officials to violate
the law and accept bad ballots was substantially greater in counties
where Bush strategists believed there were more absentee ballot
support for Bush and tried to convince election officials to accept
bad ballots.  This is consistent with \emph{The Times}' thesis and
evidence that these local election officials bent to the will of
Republican lobbyists.

\section{Invalid Overseas Absentee Ballots in Florida} \label{s:ballots}

On July 15, 2001, \textit{The New York Times} published an article,
``How Bush Took Florida: Mining the Overseas Absentee Vote,'' as the
result of its six-month investigation on the 2000 election.  \emph{The
  Times} reporters describe the details of the Bush campaign effort to
secure victory by pressuring selected local election officials to
count invalid overseas absentee ballots in Florida.  In particular,
Republicans focused on military ballots and the counties where Bush
had his strongest voting base.  For example, in counties such as
Escambia and Santa Rosa, Bush lawyers argued that every vote cast by
Americans in uniform should be counted, regardless of the letter of
the law.  In Democratic counties, Bush's lawyers argued exactly the
opposite --- that local election officials must follow the letter of
the law and disqualify any ballot not meeting the rules.

According to \emph{The Times}, this unequal pressure led to unequal
treatment by local officials of overseas voters.  That partisans would
pursue their interests creatively, relentlessly, and even
inconsistently in different places is neither a novel claim nor
remotely illegal.  That local election officials would respond to this
pressure by treating voters unequally is a more serious claim.
\emph{The Times'} view --- ``The result was unequal treatment of
ballots with the same flaws'' --- contradicts statements by Florida
Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, that the rules were applied
uniformly.  It also would seem to violate the Equal Protection Clause
of the U.S.\ Constitution, which was part of the stated grounds under
which the United States Supreme Court in \emph{Bush v.\ Gore} stopped
the manual recounts.

The 680 ballots that \emph{The Times} judged as flawed fell into one
or more of these categories (Barstow and Van Natta, Jr.,
2001):\footnote{Photographs of the bad ballots make the determination
  of flaws unambiguous; for examples, see
  \url{http://www.nytimes.com/images/2001/07/15/politics/absentee/nat_ABSENTEE_count_index.html}.}
344 ballots had late, illegible or missing postmarks (postmarks must
indicate that the ballot was cast on or before election
day);\footnote{At times, the Republicans argued that military ballots
  did not need a postmark because the law allowed those in the
  military to send mail without postage.  However, according to
  \emph{The Times}, Florida state law clearly required overseas
  ballots to be ``postmarked or signed and dated'' by election day
  (Barstow and Van Natta, Jr., 2001).}  183 ballots with United States
postmarks (overseas absentee ballots must bear foreign postmarks); 169
ballots were received from voters who were not registered, who had
failed to sign the envelope, or who had not requested a ballot; 96
ballots lacked the required signature or address of a witness; 19
voters cast two ballots, both of which counted; 5 ballots were
received after the Nov.\ 17 deadline but counted anyway.  If we knew
for which candidate the illegal ballots were cast, we would
immediately know their effect on the election. However, the secret
ballot makes this impossible in most cases.  The secret ballot was
implemented in this case by separating the envelope, with all the
information above, from the ballot contained inside the envelope once
the latter was counted.  Thus, we only have access to these envelopes,
the county in which they were counted, and county-level data on the
number of bad ballots and the number of ballots cast for Gore and
Bush.

Table~\ref{tb:ballots} illustrates the estimation problem at the state
level. The question mark indicates the unknown quantities to be
estimated.  The table illustrates that while we know the aggregate
number of invalid and valid ballots as well as the total number of
votes each candidate obtained from overseas absentee voters, we do not
know their composition, which is the goal of the analysis.  Analogous
contingency tables also exist for each of the 67 Florida counties, and
the same ecological inference problem exists in each. We also received
three other kinds of data for each county.  First, from voter
registration records, we have data about each overseas absentee voter,
including their sex, race, party registration, and whether they were
military personnel or civilian.  Second, for comparative purposes we
also have data available for election-day voters in the 67 counties.
Finally, \emph{The Times} also provided us indicator variables for
four regions in Florida and some other measures.  We use this extra
information to improve our ecological inferences.

  \end{center}
\end{table} 

\section{Ecological Inference for Flawed Ballots} \label{s:ecinf}

Table~\ref{tb:ei} presents our notation.  For each county $i$
($i=1,\dots,67$), we denote the proportion of invalid ballots among
all overseas absentee ballots as $X_i$, and the total number of
overseas absentee ballots which were counted as $N_i$.  We let Gore's
proportion of the vote be $T_i$.  To simplify presentation, we combine
the votes for Bush and the other minor candidates as Bush
votes.\footnote{Although our presentation always involves only the
  Bush/Gore choice, our empirical results using deterministic bounds
  in Section \ref{s:noassump} includes the possibility of bad ballots
  having been cast for minor party candidates.  We handle minor
  parties in our statistical analyses by ignoring the problem at first
  and then conducting sensitivity analyses in Appendix \ref{a:sens};
  since votes for minor party candidates only total 3 percent, we
  find, as expected, that they have a very small effect on the overall
  result.  Other analyses (not shown) using more computationally
  intensive techniques designed to model these choices separately
  confirm these results (see Rosen et al., 2001)\nocite{RosJaiKin01}.}
While each of these quantities are observed, we denote unobserved
quantities with Greek letters.  Namely, $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ represent
the proportions of invalid and valid ballots cast for Gore,
respectively.
\begin{table}[t]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
                & Gore  & Bush &         \\
\hline 
invalid ballots & $\bb_i$  & $1-\bb_i$ & $X_i$   \\
valid ballots   & $\bg_i$  & $1-\bg_i$ & $1-X_i$ \\
\hline
                & $T_i$ & $1-T_i$ &         \\
\end{tabular} \caption{Ecological inference for invalid overseas
  absentee ballots in Florida}\label{tb:ei}
\end{center}
\end{table} 

Although $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ are used for the estimation, our ultimate
quantity of interest is Bush's margin after dropping the invalid
absentee ballots.  To define this quantity, first define the statewide
fraction of bad ballots that went to Gore $\bb$ as the weighted
average of the individual county quantities.\footnote{The weighted
  average is $\bb=\sum_{i=1}^{67}N_i\bb_i/\sum_{i=1}^{67}N_i$.}  Thus,

\vs
\baselineskip=0.6439\baselineskip
\begin{align}
  \text{Bush's margin} & = \text{official margin}
  - [\text{Bush's bad ballots} - \text{Gore's bad ballots}] \notag\\
  & = 537 - [(1-\bb)680-\bb 680]\notag\\
  & = 1360 \bb - 143. \label{qoi}
\end{align}

\vs
\baselineskip=1.54\baselineskip
\noindent Once we estimate this quantity, we can also estimate the probability
of Gore's victory, $\Pr(\text{Bush's margin}<0)$, which is another
quantity of interest.\footnote{Note that $\bg_i$ is not used in
  Equation \ref{qoi} but is necessary as an ancillary parameter during
  estimation.}

\subsection{Analysis Without Statistical Assumptions} \label{s:noassump}

The the parameters in Table~\ref{tb:ei} follow an accounting identity
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gid}
  T_i=\bb_i X_i+\bg_i (1-X_i)
\end{equation} 
which is generated by the aggregation process, and therefore always
holds exactly with no stochastic term. It also implies a deterministic
linear relationship between the two unknown parameters,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:identity}
\bg_i = \frac{T_i}{1-X_i}-\frac{X_i}{1-X_i}\bb_i,
\end{equation}
which traces out what \citet{king:97} calls a tomography line.  In
addition, before we observe $X_i$ and $T_i$ in any county, we also
know that $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ are each between 0 and 1.  Once we
observe $X_i$ and $T_i$, we can narrow the bounds further (by
projecting the line in Equation \ref{eq:identity} to the two axes).
Thus, without any statistical assumptions, we can derive the upper and
lower bounds of $\bg_i$ and $\bb_i$ for each county $i$, which in turn
imply the bounds for our quantity of interest, Bush's margin after
dropping flawed overseas absentee ballots.
\begin{table}[t]

\end{tabular} \caption{Analysis of bounds for the state  and 
  selected counties.}\label{tb:bounds}
\end{center}
\end{table} 

Table~\ref{tb:bounds} shows how the analysis of bounds can be very
powerful in some situations. For example, Escambia is one of the
counties where many invalid ballots were found. At the same time, this
county is one of Bush's strongholds: about 76 percent of overseas
absentee ballots for this county were counted for Bush. In Escambia,
there were 208 total votes, 47 for Gore, 154 for Bush, and 7 for
others. Of these votes, 102 ballots were invalid. Because Bush had 154
total votes, it is possible that all 102 of these invalid ballots were
Bush's votes. This produces the lower bound on the number of valid
Bush's votes, namely 52.  The upper bound occurs when Gore and other
candidates get assigned the maximum number of invalid ballots. Since
Gore had 47 votes and other candidates got 7 votes, the maximum number
of invalid ballots that can be assigned to them is 54, leaving 48
invalid votes for Bush. Hence, the maximum number of valid votes for
Bush is his official count of 154 minus these 48, which is 106.
%The analysis of bounds shows that the minimum number of invalid
%ballots cast for Bush was as high as 48 votes while that for Gore is
%zero. Thus we know that at least 19 percent of invalid ballots belong
%to Bush rather than Gore.
%Santa Rosa County is similar: Out of the total of 55 flawed absentee
%ballots, at least 37 votes were cast for Bush, yielding the upper
%bound on the number of valid Bush's votes, which is 28.  
Finally, Baker County illustrates why sometimes the ``secret ballot''
is not really secret.  In this county, only one absentee ballot was
cast and also was found to be invalid. Hence, we know from the total
tally of absentee ballots in this county -- one vote for Bush -- that
this person voted for Bush and that it was an invalid ballot but
included in the official count.\footnote{Indeed, the name, address,
  and individual vote cast of all people in counties, like Baker, that
  cast all their absentee ballots for one candidate, are on the public
  record.  This is because the bounds have zero width whenever either
  $X_i$ or $T_i$ is zero or one.}

From these county level bounds, we derive aggregate bounds for the
total number of invalid ballots for each candidate at the state level.
The result shows that at least 8 percent, or 128 votes of Bush's 1,575
absentee ballots, should not have been counted, whereas for Gore the
minimum number of invalid ballots is only 5 out of his total 836 votes
(0.6 percent).  Furthermore, Bush could have inappropriately benefited
from up to 668 out of the 680 invalid ballots.

The most significant conclusion from this analysis is that we cannot
exclude the possibility that Gore actually won the election.  That is,
without making any assumptions other than that \emph{The Times} coding
decisions were correct (and again, we saw no objection to them in the
media discussion that followed their story), the 537 Bush margin now
changes to somewhere from a 126 vote victory for Gore to a 936 vote
victory for Bush.  Once the ballots were removed from the envelopes,
America forever gave up the possibility of knowing for certain who won
the most votes in the 2000 election.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis with a Single Model Specification}
\label{s:onemodel} 

The lack of any statistical assumptions puts the analysis in Section
\ref{s:noassump} on extremely firm footing.  In fact, measurement
error aside, the conclusions there contain no inferential
uncertainties at all, which is of course quite unusual for social
science research.  If the resulting bounds excluded the possibility of
one candidate winning, our analysis would end right here.
Unfortunately, all we know from the bounds is that there exists a
\emph{possibility} that either Gore or Bush received more votes.
Indeed, even of all but a tiny piece of the bounded interval reflected
a Bush (or a Gore) victory, it would provide no information about the
\emph{probability} that a particular candidate won (since the bounds
alone do not imply any probability distribution over the interval).
As such, the \emph{Times} needed us to go further than the bounds and
to make an inference about the probability that Gore really won.  For
that quantity of interest, the bounds are in sufficient.

In order to learn more about who actually won the election --- the
likely margins of victory within the deterministic bounds --- the only
option is to add some statistical assumptions.  With these
assumptions, we can make probabilistic statements about our quantities
of interest.  The problem with any model-based statistical analysis,
of course, is that there might be a disagreement about the assumptions
to be made, and so the price of the more precise conclusions that
follow is the additional uncertainty due to model specification.  This
is a common problem in social science research, but it is particularly
salient when attempting to provide independent nonpartisan advice in
the midst of one of the most highly charged partisan debates in modern
times.  Our approach to this problem is to formally incorporate
uncertainty due to model specification into our final estimate.

We use the class of ecological inference models given in King
(1997)\nocite{king:97}, which have come to called EI after the
software that implements them.  To begin, we summarize graphically the
bounds obtained in Section~\ref{s:noassump}.  For each Florida
county, we show all \emph{possible} values of $\bg_i$ and of $\bb_i$.
As it turns out, the data tell us more than merely the bounds on each
separately since Equation~\ref{eq:identity} says that if $\bg_i$ is
near the top of its bounds, $\bb_i$ must be near the bottom of its
bounds.  In fact, the two are perfectly correlated and fall on a line
defined by that equation.  To illustrate, we plot one line for each
county in Florida in the tomography plot of Figure~\ref{fg:tomog},
which merely re-expresses the data in the form closest to the answers
we seek.
\begin{figure}[t]
  %\vspace{-1in}\hspace{0.5in}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{6.5in}

      %\includegraphics[width=4.5in,height=6in,angle=-90]{tomog}

    \end{center}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{\label{fg:tomog}
    Tomography plot for invalid overseas absentee ballots.  $\bb$ and
    $\bg$ are the proportion of Gore's invalid and valid ballots,
    respectively.  Each line traces out the possible values of the
    $\bb_i,\bg_i$ point for each county $i$. The solid line is for
    Escambia county.}
\end{figure}

All of the above is as far as it is possible to go without making
statistical assumptions.  Next, we add three assumptions, all
conditional on $X$ and a specified set of control variables $Z$.  We
could begin with the assumption that $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ are the same
for all counties, which is essentially Goodman's regression.  This
would be enough to identify the model, but it would be a very strong
assumption, and indeed in our application it can be rejected with
certainty by merely examining Figure \ref{fg:tomog}.

Thus, instead of assuming that $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ are the same over
counties, we assume that they come from the same distribution (the
truncated bivariate normal distribution, with truncation kept to the
square in the figure).  The idea is that whatever the values of the
unknown parameters from Florida's 67 counties on their respective
tomography lines, they all have something in common --- since they are
all in the same state, subject to almost the same electoral campaign,
etc.  Differences of any size across the counties in these parameters
are thus allowed so long as they are either random and fit the
distributional assumption or they are systematic and taken into
account by control variables.  The main constraints added by this
assumption is that the bivariate density is unimodal (which is the
formalization of the assumption that the counties ``have something in
common'') and that all volume under the density appears over the
square represented by the tomography plot.  Violations of this
distributional assumption do not seem to affect the quantities we need
for this application (see King, 1997: Table 9.2).

The second assumption is that the absence of residual spatial
correlation in $T$ after taking into account $X$ and $Z$.  King's
ecological inference model has been shown to be relatively insensitive
to anything but extreme levels of spatial autocorrelation (King, 1997:
Table 9.1, King, 2000)\nocite{King00}, but we make this assumption
even more plausible by including tests with covariates that tap into
Florida's regions and other spatial features.

The final assumption states that the two unknown quantities, $\bb_i$
and $\bg_i$, are independent of $X_i$, given $Z$.  For example, if
more bad ballots cast for Gore, $\bb_i$, came from counties with more
bad ballots overall, $X_i$, then this assumption would be violated
unless $Z$ included variables that sufficiently controlled for this
relationship.  This is the most critical of the three assumptions, and
so the validity of the analysis depends crucially on the content of
$Z$.  Each of these three assumptions can be modified or relaxed by
the inclusion of different covariates, $Z$, and so the main model
uncertainty that is assumed presently is $Z$.

\subsection{Statistical Analyses that Acknowledge Model Uncertainty}\label{s:multmodel}

Sensitivity to model specification in quantitative political science
is perhaps most commonly seen when minor changes among the explanatory
variables in regression-type analyses result in large differences in
the resulting estimates.  The endemic nature of such model dependent
inferences makes a decision to base inferences on a single model in
most situations highly dubious.  This is all the more so in ecological
inference where model dependence is more frequently an issue.  Yet,
almost all existing applications of ecological inference use a single
specification.  Indeed, few use any explanatory variables, $Z$, at
all.

The partisan nature of the controversy in which we were providing
advice makes the issue of model dependence especially salient,
although it is not markedly different from other applications.  We
began by following the most common procedure of estimating many models
(i.e., with different $Z$) and assessing the degree to which our
ultimate quantities of interest depend on the specification.  This was
informative but insufficient, since our assignment was to provide a
single inference with a point estimate and confidence interval.

Three basic ways of drawing inferences in the presence of model
uncertainty have been discussed.  Some researchers persist in choosing
a single model, perhaps on the basis of qualitative arguments about
its merits, and draw inferences assuming its veracity.  This
optimistic approach typically overestimates the degree to which the
researcher is certain of the correct model specification, and hence
typically gives high variance estimates and overly narrow confidence
intervals.  Other researchers use a formal model selection criterion,
such as stepwise regression, Mallow's Cp, AIC, etc., to pick the best
model.  Although these procedures are inappropriate when estimating
causal effects, they are reasonable when the quantity of interest is
predictive, such as ecological inference.  Unfortunately, even in
these situations the result of applying these criteria is one model,
which also ignores model uncertainty.

An approach now widely recognized to be superior to any model
selection criterion is Bayesian model averaging, which we apply to our
ecological inference problem.  The basic idea is to estimate a large
number of potential models and to take the weighted average of their
results, with weights based on probability that a model is correct.
The correctness of the model is not assumed ex ante; nor is it merely
based on goodness of fit; it is instead calculated from the data via
Bayesian analysis.  The key result of Bayesian model averaging is that
the inferences it produces (1) are more accurate than those produced
by standard model selection criterion, (2) formally incorporate all
model uncertainties in our inferences, (3) outperform any of the
individual models that are averaged over.  The last property does not
depend on whether the true model generating the data lies inside or
outside models averaged over. That is, inferences from Bayesian model
averaging always outperform any individual model considered
\citep{madi:raft:94}.\footnote{This result is similar to insights from
  the closely related literature on committee methods \citep{bish:95},
  although surprisingly the literatures have relatively few
  cross-citations.  See also Rosen, Jiang, and Tanner (2000) and
  Robert (1996)\nocite{rose:jian:tann:00,robe:96a}.  See
  \citet{hoet:madi:raft:voli:99} for a general introduction to
  Bayesian model averaging.  \citet{drap:95} discusses how Bayesian
  model averaging deals with the model uncertainty.  See
  \citet{bart:97}, \citet{BarZal01}, and \citet{EriBafWil02} for
  political science applications that use an approximation to formal
  Bayesian model averaging.} Model averaging thus allows one to
consider a wide range of models, while still producing one set of
results.

Of course, one can never cover the entire model space, which is
normally of infinite size, since Bayesian model averaging only allows
one to include a finite number of models.  Therefore, the resulting
inferences can always be improved by adding additional models, no
matter how many models have already been included.  This is not a
unique feature of Bayesian model averaging since it is always possible
to come up with a better model in any statistical analysis.  However,
Bayesian model averaging offers a significant improvement over the
usual approach of basing inferences on one assumed model, no matter
how that model is chosen.

Bayesian model averaging is especially important in our application
since political scientists have rarely studied absentee ballots and we
therefore have little prior theory with which to assist in model
specification.  The procedure thus enables us to conduct an analysis
without having to defend one particular specification, or even a small
set of specifications.  We came up with our list of models by talking
in detail to reporters and partisans on both sides.  We then
formalized \emph{every} intuition any of them mentioned in an
ecological inference model (by defining $Z$) and we included every one
in our analysis.  We also included a number of others we came up with
independently.

Our search for models identified 31 possibilities for $Z$, including
including race, sex, and party registration for the overseas absentee
voters as well as models based on 24 county level election and
demographic variables.  We also include a model with no covariates and
3 models with $X_i$ as the covariate for the mean of $\bb$, $\bg$, and
for both.\footnote{\label{f:models}A list of all 31 models follows:
  (1) no covariate, (2) $X_i$ for $\bb$, (3) $X_i$ for $\bg$, (4)
  $X_i$ for both $\bb$ and $\bg$, (5) military absentee voters, (6)
  registered Republican absentee voters, (7) registered Democratic
  absentee voters, (8) female absentee voters, (9) White absentee
  voters, (10) Black absentee voters, (11) Hispanic absentee voters,
  (12) rejected military absentee voters, (13) rejected registered
  Republican absentee voters, (14) rejected registered Democratic
  absentee voters, (15) rejected female absentee voters, (16) rejected
  White absentee voters, (17) rejected Black absentee voters, (18)
  rejected Hispanic absentee voters, (19) Democratic vote share among
  residents, (20) vote share of Republican candidates, (21) vote share
  of other candidates, (22) registered Democratic residents, (23)
  registered Republican residents, registered Black Democratic
  residents, (24) proportion of voting age population not registered,
  (25) Black registered Democrats, (26) Black registered Republican
  residents, (27) acceptance ratio of overall absentee ballots, (28)
  ratio of invalid absentee ballots, (29) Panhandle Florida regional
  indicator variable, (30) Southern Florida regional indicator
  variable, (31) corruption indicator. All the covariates except
  indicator variables are entered as a ratio varying from 0 to 1.
  Except the first three models, the covariate was used to model the
  conditional untruncated mean of both parameters, $\bb$ and $\bg$.
  Models (5) to (11) are based on information about the absentee
  ballots and so different variables were available regarding the
  invalid and valid ballots; we used the former group to predict $\bb$
  and the latter to predict $\bg$.  We reran each model with different
  starting values to verify that we found the global maximum.  We also
  examined each of the tomography plots with confidence regions to
  search for outliers or bad model fits.  In addition, we plotted
  $E(T|X)$ or $E(T|X,Z)$ by $X$ or $Z$, and checked whether the
  observed $T$ fell within the (say) 90\% confidence interval 90\% of
  the time.}  Each of our models includes at most two covariates.  In
part this is because no one including journalists and academics
proposed a model that clearly was defined by more.  But more
importantly, we know that better predictions can be obtained when not
overfitting the data with many covariates.  Hoeting et al.\ (1999) and
Madigan and Raftery (1994) and others have shown that Bayesian model
averaging almost never puts much weight on such models, and predictive
inferences (unlike some causal inferences) are typically better with
parsimonious specifications.\footnote{Multiple covariates uncorrelated
  with $X_i$ causes no identification problems in EI.  Ecological
  inference models that do not incorporate information from the
  deterministic bounds (such as in Goodman, 1953\nocite{goodman53})
  are not identified when including $X_i$ or variables related to
  $X_i$ as covariates (King, 1997: 42).  Thus, to the extent that
  ecological inference models that incorporate the bounds, such as EI,
  are estimable when including $X_i$ or covariates that are related to
  $X_i$, the information that makes this possible is coming from the
  bounds.  Although no covariates, or one or possibly two are often
  well identified, the point at which the specification is trying to
  extract information that is unavailable comes quickly.  Moreover, in
  the space of the inferences being made, the predictions about the
  quantities of inferences in EI are not often greatly affected by
  including more than one covariate at a time.}

\section{Empirical Results}
\label{s:outcome}

\subsection{The Probability That Gore Would Have Won Without Bad 
Absentee Ballots}

Figure \ref{fg:margin} portrays the posterior distribution from our
analysis of Bush's margin of victory if the bad ballots had not been
counted (the histogram of 1000 draws from the posterior).  Note first
that, as required by the procedure, all area for this distribution is
contained within the bounds we found for this quantity of $-126$ to
936.  The weight of the statistical evidence within these bounds
clearly demonstrates that Bush benefited considerably by the bad
ballots, and removing them thus takes away from his margin.  This is
evident in the figure because almost all of the area of the histogram
of posterior probability falls to the left of the official margin of
537.  The mean margin of victory for Bush without the bad ballots is
only 251 votes.  The figure also portrays the probability that Gore
actually won the election by the area under the curve to the left of
zero.  This is only about 0.2 percent, indicating that Gore probably
would not have won, even if the bad ballots had been discarded.

  680 invalid overseas absentee ballots} \label{fg:margin}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

\subsection{Other Counterfactuals}

While our results indicate that it is unlikely that invalid overseas
absentee ballots alone would have changed the election outcome, the
illegally counted ballots could have had a much more a significant
effect when combined with slight changes in decisions regarding the
manual recounts.  We show this result by first focusing on several
scenarios about the two key counties where a manual recount was
conducted, Miami Dade and Palm Beach. In Miami Dade County, election
officials decided to stop the manual recount when they made the
judgment that they could not meet the recount deadline, set by the
Florida Supreme Court, 5p.m.  Sunday, November 27.  The partial manual
recount gave a net gain of 157 votes to Gore. In Palm Beach county,
they also could not finish the manual recount, but they submitted the
result of the partial recount just before the deadline, which would
have given Gore a net gain of 192 votes for Gore. Later that day, Palm
Beach electoral officials reported the result of the complete recount
to Katherine Harris.  She rejected this complete recount as well as
the partial recount and did not include them in the certified official
tally, thereby denying Gore a total of 349 votes
\nocite{purd:00}(Purdum, 2000).

  \end{minipage}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The panel of Table~\ref{tb:senario} marked ``actual recounts''
presents our prediction for Bush's margin and Gore's probability of
victory in situations where the invalid overseas absentee ballots had
been rejected \emph{and} the recounts in one or both of these counties
had been included in the final tally.  For example, if the recounted
votes in Miami Dade and Palm Beach had all been counted, Gore would
have won with a 0.82 probability, with the uncertainty in this number
coming only from our analysis of the bad overseas absentee ballots.
If only the Palm Beach votes had been counted, Gore would have won
with 0.29 probability.  To put it one way, the massive differences in
the probabilities from 0.002 to 0.82 for a Gore victory were all due
to the decisions of Katherine Harris.  Of course, these decisions
could have been overturned by the courts, and the candidates could
have influenced them if they had requested statewide or different
types of recounts.

In the last panel of Table \ref{tb:senario}, we consider
counterfactuals where the invalid overseas absentee ballots had not
been counted and election day voting recounts had occurred in various
ways, as suggested by a study conducted by a consortium of media
organizations (Fessenden and Broder, 2001).  For example, this
analysis shows that if the U.S.\ Supreme Court had not stopped the
recount in \emph{Bush v.\ Gore}, the victor would have changed with
only a 1\% probability.  However, if Gore's formal request that
Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and Voulusia counties be recounted
had been granted, then he would have been elected with a 73\%
probability.  If the entire state had been recounted, according to
almost any standard for judging the punch cards, Gore would have won
election with a very high probability.

\subsection{Indirect Evidence of Local Election Officials Responding
  to Republican Pressure}

Six months of interviews and archival research on the ground in
Florida and elsewhere led reporters from \emph{The New York Times} to
conclude that, ``the Republicans mounted a legal and public relations
campaign to persuade canvassing boards in Bush strongholds to waive
the state's election laws when counting overseas absentee
ballots.\ldots Their goal was simple: to count the maximum number of
overseas ballots in counties won by Mr.  Bush, particularly those with
a high concentration of military voters, while seeking to disqualify
overseas ballots in counties won by Vice President Al Gore.''
\emph{The Times} claimed that as a direct result of this pressure,
``canvassing boards in about a dozen Republican-leaning counties had
reconvened for a second round of counting.  In each place,
longstanding election rules were bent and even ignored.  Boards
counted ballots postmarked as many as seven days after the election,
including some from within the United States.  They counted two
ballots sent by fax.  Officials in Santa Rosa County even counted five
ballots that arrived after the Nov.\ 17 deadline.  Again and again,
election officials crossed out the words `REJECTED AS ILLEGAL' that
had been stamped on ballot envelopes.''

If these claims are correct, we ought to be able to find evidence of
them in our data.  We conduct two tests.  In the first, we divide
Florida's counties into three categories --- the six counties
mentioned explicitly in \emph{The Times} story where the Republicans
pressured officials to count illegal ballots, the four counties
mentioned where Republicans pressured local election officials not to
count the ballots, and the remaining counties which were not
mentioned.  We then compute various statistics for these three
categories and present them for comparison in Table \ref{t:cty}.  (The
results in this table were not available to the reporters before their
article appeared and so Table \ref{t:cty} does represent an
independent test.)

\end{table}

The evidence strikingly supports \emph{The Times'} account of events.
The first two columns of Table \ref{t:cty} report on the
characteristics of the county, information available to Republican
strategists before they started lobbying.  With the exception of two
counties with very few absentee ballots, the counties identified as
areas where the Republicans focused their efforts to count ballots
were those with large populations of military personnel and Republican
voters.  Similarly, the counties \emph{The Times} identified as places
where Republicans discouraged the ballots from being counted had
consistently fewer military personnel and Republican voters.

The result of the Republican efforts also appears to have been
successful.  A larger fraction of bad ballots were counted in all
counties where Republicans tried to get them counted than the average,
and a smaller fraction than the average were counted in every county
where the Republicans tried to have them not counted.  
The fraction of bad ballots accepted that had been cast for Bush also
supports the same theory: Fewer of the counted bad ballots had been
Bush voters when the Republicans tried not to have ballots counted
than in every county where the Republicans tried to have them counted.

\emph{The Times'} report also helps explain some interesting
variations in this table.  First, we would have expected more Bush
votes among the bad ballots than we found in Duval County because it
had so many military personnel.  However, \emph{The Times} reported
that an election official on the Duval County canvassing board ``held
the line on counting ballots with missing postmarks.''  Similarly,
Pasco County has relatively low numbers of military ballots and a
small Republican vote share.  So we might expect that this county to
have had relatively few of the bad ballots being cast for Bush.
However, the story also described the unusually strong Republican
pressure applied in this county: ```It looks to me like we've got a
lot of pressure here,' Judge Robert P.  Cole, chairman of the Pasco
board, said as he faced a throng of cheering Republicans and more than
a dozen Bush representatives [and no officials from the Gore
campaign].''  Our quantitative results are certainly consistent with
this qualitative evidence.

We also look for indirect evidence of local election officials
succumbing to pressure from Republican Party officials by examining
the posterior probabilities of each of the 31 component models we
included.  Generally, if \emph{The Times'} hypothesis is right, we
would expect that the covariates that have the biggest effects would
be related to where Republicans tried hardest to influence local
officials.  If they were as rational and deliberate as \emph{The
  Times} suggested, these would be counties where they expected the
largest numbers of bad ballots that, if counted, would help Bush's
cause.  Obviously, we have no such variable, but we do have a variety
of variables related to this.

Table~\ref{tb:bma} gives the top six models listed in order of the
posterior probability of being correct.  In the top six, two have the
largest effects and both are consistent with the theory: The more
absentee voters registered as Republicans, and the more white absentee
voters in a district, the more bad ballots were cast for Bush (the
negative sign indicating that Bush's lead is reduced when these
ballots are not counted).  The other covariates have comparatively
small effects.

\end{table}

The large variation in our prediction for Bush's margin across the six
models in Table~\ref{tb:bma} emphasizes a clear advantage of our
Bayesian model averaging procedure.  The variation results from the
large degree of model dependence in these data (because the data have
fairly wide bounds).  For example, the specification with white
absentee voters gives a confidence interval which, when considered in
isolation from the other models, would not enable us to reject the
hypothesis that Gore won if only the overseas absentee ballots had
been rejected.  This is obviously quite different from our overall
result of only a 0.2 percent probability that Gore won.  Since
different specifications yield very different inferences, an analyst
having to choose one model would be in the untenable position of
having to defend choices without a lot of prior evidence.  

Bayesian model averaging offers a way around this common problem.
Instead of results jumping dramatically from one specification to the
next, inferences resulting from Bayesian model averaging do not change
as much when new models are added to the specification, unless they
have especially large probabilities of being true.  Of course, we
cannot get something for nothing.  Our procedure is an improvement
over straight EI because we only need to assume that one of our 31
models, or some combination of our 31 models, contains something close
to the right model.  This is in contrast to the usual approach where
we merely get one model from which to choose, but it is not a panacea:
although if someone comes up with a new idea for a model, we can
include it, but if none or no combination of those we consult comes
close to the right model, then our procedure will obviously fail to
give valid answers.


\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{s:concl}

Counterfactual analysis is normally difficult, and especially so when
the subject of the inference is far from the factual evidence.  When
the counterfactual is very close to the data, however, we stand an
especially good chance of making valid inferences (King and Zeng,
2001; Lebow, 2000)\nocite{KinZen01,Lebow00}.  The counterfactuals in
the case of Florida are especially clear and easily could have
happened, which makes the results of this case study somewhat more
certain than usual.  If the problem of the overseas absentee ballots
had been litigated and the law applied equally in every county (as
\emph{Bush v.\ Gore} required of the votes cast on election day), the
bad ballots might very well have been disqualified.  In this
situation, although Gore probably would have lost, we conclude that no
one will ever be able to say with certainty who would have won the
American presidential election if all American laws had been followed.
Also, if the Florida Secretary of State had different views on issues
that were at least somewhat open to discretion, the outcome of the
election might very well have changed.  Of course, a few different
decisions by the candidates on visits to Florida, campaign spending,
Elian Gonzalos, or any of a variety of other issues might also have
produced a different outcome.  Our results also provide indirect, but
strong and independent support for the thesis that local election
officials bent to the persuasive efforts of Republican strategists to
follow the law in Gore counties and break it in Bush areas.

Finally, we think this paper also provides an especially good example
of the use of Bayesian model averaging.  We have developed the
application of it to the ecological inference model and offer computer
code for others to use it.  
%In applied work, Bayesian model averaging
%has been approximated, such as with the BIC, but its full version has
%not seen as much use as it could.
Bayesian model averaging is a clear improvement on the usual situation
of having to select and defend a single model, but it is of course not
a panacea. A researcher never knows whether all relevant models have
been included and, although its results are more robust than
single-model approaches, it is always possible to come up with a
different list of models and produce a different result.  And so in
the end, and as always, the investigator's judgment always plays an
important role in making inferences.  Model averaging cannot
substitute for judgment, but it can help account for model
uncertainties where prior knowledge is not available. Furthermore, in
the present case, where 100\% confidence intervals are available (in
the form of bounds on the parameters), we also have additional
constraints on possible results.

\section{Technical Issues in Modeling and Estimation} \label{appx:king}

From one application of one specification of this model, we compute
the posterior density of a quantity of interest $\Delta$ by drawing it
from its posterior, conditional on the model $\P(\Delta|M_k,T)$.  To
do this, we draw simulations of $\bb$ and $\bg$ from their posterior
and calculate simulations of $\Delta$.  Bayes theorem specifies that
the posterior is proportional to the product of the prior times the
likelihood, $\P(\Theta|T) \propto \P(\Theta)\P(T|\Theta)$, where
$\P(\Theta)$ is the prior probability distribution on some unknown
parameter $\Theta$, and $\P(T|\Theta)$ is the likelihood.  Everything
is conditioned on $X$, $N$, and $Z$, which we observe.  We use the
standard independent prior on each parameter of $\Theta$ as described
in \citet{king:97}.  This prior distribution and the likelihood
function together define King's model in a standard Bayesian
framework.

Let $M_k$ denote the $k$th model specification ($k=1,\dots,31$). Then
we make an inference about a quantity of interest $\Delta$ by
computing its posterior distribution via Bayesian model averaging.  To
do this, we first compute, for each model, the posterior distribution
of $\Delta$ (computed from the posterior with $\Delta$ being some
known function of $\Theta$): $\P(\Delta|M_k,T)$.  Then we average over
these models by weighting by the relative posterior probability that
each model is correct given the data, $\Pr(M_k|T)$: $\Pr(\Delta|T) =
\sum_{k=1}^{31} \P(\Delta|M_k,T) \Pr(M_k|T)$, where the posterior
model probability is $\Pr(M_k|T)=\P(T|M_k)\Pr(M_k)/[\sum_{j=1}^{31}
\Pr(T|M_j) \Pr(M_j)]$.  This is the probability that model $k$ is
correct, given the set of models in the analysis; it should not be
confused with $R^2$-like measures which typically reward models that
over-fit without distinguishing systematic from idiosyncratic features
of the data.

To compute the posterior model probability, we need two elements.
First is a prior probability that each model is correct, $\Pr(M_k)$,
which we set to uniform.  The other is the marginal likelihood,
$\P(T|M_k)$, which is obtained by averaging the likelihood over the
prior distribution.\footnote{\label{eq:marglik}The marginal likelihood
  is $\P(T|M_k) = \int \P(T|\Theta_k, M_k) \P(\Theta_k|M_k)
  d\Theta_k$, where $\P(\Theta_j|M_j)$ is the prior distribution for
  the parameter vector $\Theta$ in Model $k$.}  The marginal
likelihood is ``the probability of seeing the data that actually were
observed, calculated \emph{before} any data became available''
\cite[p.776]{kass:raft:95}.  That is, instead of maximizing the
likelihood with respect to the parameter given the data, as we would
do to compute the maximum likelihood estimate, the marginal likelihood
does not have a maximization step: it is the average value of the
likelihood evaluated at parameter values drawn from their prior
density.  (Although this quantity could be computed by simulation in
this way, such a method tends to be highly inefficient, especially for
problems with relatively flat priors or high dimensional parameter
vectors.)

To compute the marginal likelihood, we use the Laplace approximation,
% \begin{equation}
%   \P(T|M_k) \approx (2 \pi)^{{d_k}/2}|\widehat V(\hat\Theta_k)|^{1/2}
%   \P(T|\hat{\Theta}_k) \P(\hat{\Theta}_k),
% \end{equation}
% where, for Model $k$, $\hat{\Theta}_k$ is the posterior mode, $\hat
% V(\hat\Theta_k)$ is minus the inverse Hessian of the posterior
% evaluated at the mode, and $d_k$ is the number of parameters.  The
% Laplace approximation 
which is known to perform well compared with other methods
\citep{raft:96,lewi:raft:97,dici:kass:raft:wass:97}.\footnote{If a
  model is estimated through a Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation,
  one can construct an algorithm where the chain visits each model
  stochastically and can thus compute the posterior model probability
  as a direct output of the posterior draws \citep{chib:95}.  However,
  this requires constructing a new MCMC algorithm for each
  application.}  Its rate of approximation is $O(n^{-1})$, which is
considerably better than easier-to-apply methods such as Bayesian
information criteria (BIC), which has a rate of only $O(n^{-1/2})$
\citep{kass:tier:kada:89}.  For example, Kass and Raftery (1995: 778)
say that ``even for very large samples, it [BIC] does not produce the
correct value.''  Hence, in our application the Laplace approximation
is more appropriate than BIC.

\section{The Minor Effects of Minor Candidates and Prior Densities}\label{a:sens}

Here, we analyze the effects on our results of ignoring the minor
party candidates and also study the sensitivity of our results to our
choices for model priors.  Figure~\ref{fg:sensitivity} plots the
posterior distribution of Bush's new margin without invalid overseas
absentee ballots for different model specifications for comparison
with our posterior distribution.  The solid line in this figure is an
alternative specification of the ecological inference model where we
combine the votes for the minor candidates together with those for
Gore rather than with the votes for Bush, resulting in 31 new
individual models corresponding to the 31 models already run.  The
posterior distribution for this model is very similar to the results
of our previous analysis indicating that our results do not depend on
which model specification is used.
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in,angle=-90]{sensitivity}
\caption{Sensitivity analysis of Bayesian model
  averaging. The histogram is the posterior distribution of Bush's new
  margin for our model, while the other lines give posterior
  distributions from different models and prior specifications.}
\label{fg:sensitivity}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

The other two lines represent the use of different prior distributions
for the coefficients of the covariate of each model.  We use different
prior standard deviations for the coefficients of the covariates to
see if the results are sensitive to the choice of the prior
distribution.  While some feature of the posterior do vary across
specifications, the graph shows that model results are not
particularly sensitive to the prior specification.  The median
posterior point in particular is hardly changed across the models.

\subsection{Model Fit}\label{a:fit}

We reran each model with different starting values to verify that we
found the global maximum.  We also examined each of the tomography
plots with contours or confidence intervals to search for outliers or
bad model fits.  In addition, we plotted $E(T|X)$ or $E(T|X,Z)$ by $X$
or $Z$, and checked whether the observed $T$ fell within the (say)
90\% confidence interval 90\% of the time.

We also looked at whether the first stage of the model (i.e., before
conditioning on $T_i$) fit by comparing the county-level posterior
predictive confidence interval for $T_i$ to its observed value.
Figure \ref{fg:fit} gives several examples of this strategy for two of
the models we ran (in the first two rows), as well as for the ultimate
model implied by the entire Bayesian model averaging procedure (in the
last row).  The first column plots these predictive confidence
intervals by $X_i$, the fraction of bad ballots.  The second column
plots the same intervals by the covariate included.  The proportion of
observed $T_i$ points falling inside the 80\% confidence intervals is
always approximately 80\%, which is one check on model fit.  Another
is the lack of any noticeable relationship between the degree to which
the observed $T_i$ deviates from the center of the conference interval
and the variable plotted on the horizontal axis.  All these
diagnostics, and other similar graphs we examined, seem to confirm the
fit of the model to these data.

  $Z_i$, in the second column.  The first two rows give selected
  individual models and the last is the full model computed via
  Bayesian model averaging.  Dots represent the true values of $T_i$
