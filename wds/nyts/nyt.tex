\begin{abstract}
  Although not widely known until much later, Al Gore received 202
  more votes than George W.\ Bush on election day in Florida.  George
  W.\ Bush is president because he overcame his election day deficit
  with overseas absentee ballots that arrived and were counted after
  election day.  In the final official tally, Bush received 537 more
  votes than Gore.  These numbers are taken from the official results
  released by the Florida Secretary of State's office and so do not
  reflect overvotes, undervotes, unsuccessful litigation, butterfly
  ballot problems, recounts that might have been allowed but were not,
  or any other hypothetical divergence between voter preferences and
  counted votes.  After the election, the \emph{New York Times}
  conducted a six month long investigation and found that 680 of the
  overseas absentee ballots were illegally counted, and no partisan,
  pundit, or academic has publicly disagreed with their assessment.
  In this paper, we describe the statistical procedures we developed
  and implemented for the \emph{Times} to ascertain whether
  disqualifying these 680 ballots would have changed the outcome of
  the election.  The methods involve adding formal Bayesian model
  averaging procedures to King's (1997) ecological inference model.
  Formal Bayesian model averaging has not been used in political
  science but is especially useful when substantive conclusions depend
  heavily on apparently minor but indefensible model choices, when
  model generalization is not feasible, and when potential critics are
  more partisan than academic.  We show how we derived the results for
  the \emph{Times} so that other scholars can use these methods to
  make ecological inferences for other purposes.  We also present a
  variety of new empirical results that delineate the precise
  conditions under which Al Gore would have been elected president,
  and offer new evidence of the striking effectiveness of the
  Republican effort to convince local election officials to count
  invalid ballots in Bush counties and not count them in Gore
  counties.

\section{Introduction}

Many aspects of the 2000 election were the subject of considerable
media attention and litigation in the uncertain month that followed
the voting, and, as such, considerable information about the process
is on the public record.  For example, we know how the butterfly
ballot in Palm Beach County led to the disqualification of many votes
that were apparently intended for Gore
\citep{wand:schot:sekh:meba:herr:brad:01,AdaFas00}.  By all accounts,
this effect was inadvertent, as indicated by the failure of the
Democrats to object to this ballot design prior to the election when
they were permitted to do so, and it was not illegal.  We also now
know a great deal about hanging chads, overvotes, undervotes, and
various other failures of punch card ballot designs.\footnote{See
  Herron and Sekhon (2001).\nocite{HerSek01} The 2000 election
  produced literally dozens of papers, many written within days of the
  election and posted on the web.  For links to many on this growing
  list, see \url{http://madison.hss.cmu.edu/}.}  Democrats and
Republicans worked hard at convincing the Courts and local election
officials to count and recount the ballots the way they wanted, but
ultimately the system produced an explicit and final decision about
each of these elements of the overall picture.  Many decisions were
tremendously controversial, but they were official, legal decisions
made in the presence of full information and were eventually accepted
by almost all concerned.

In contrast, the overseas absentee ballots were spared most of this
attention and all litigation.  Yet, they clearly determined the
outcome of the election: If only the votes cast on election day were
counted, Al Gore would have beat George W.\ Bush by 202 votes and
become the next president.  According to official results from the
State of Florida, it took the overseas absentee ballots for Bush to
outdistance Gore, which he did in the end by 537 votes (see Table
\ref{tb:official}).  The extent to which the law was followed in this
small but consequential part of the story escaped scrutiny for some
time. After the election was decided, however, the \emph{New York
  Times} conducted a six month long investigation during which they
retrieved the envelopes in which the ballots were mailed, and searched
for violations of the law (Barstow and Van Natta, Jr., 2001).  In one
of the longest set of articles ever published by the \emph{Times},
they concluded that 680 of the overseas absentee ballots that had been
counted by Florida counties unambiguously violated one or more aspects
of Florida election law and, by any reasonable interpretation of the
law, should have been discarded.  Indeed, after the \emph{Times} story
appeared, commentators and partisans did not contradict these factual
claims.

\end{center}
\end{table} 

In comparison with other features of the election that have been
studied, this problem was not caused by old machines or the
inattention of local election officials or political party
representatives.  It is also not a theoretical problem, in the sense
that it does not rely on comparing the intent of the voters with the
official vote.  Rather, according to the \emph{Times}, the overseas
ballot problem was due to blatantly illegal actions on the part of
local election officials that had not been previously noticed.  The
\emph{Times} argued that local officials were influenced by the
deliberate political strategies employed by the Bush campaign, and
comparative neglect by the Democrats.\footnote{The Democrats had
  planned to contest the absentee ballots, but Democratic Vice
  Presidential Candidate Joe Lieberman on Meet the Press ended this
  strategy when he explained that he ``would give the benefit of the
  doubt to ballots coming in from military personnel generally.\ldots
  Al Gore and I don't want to ever be part of anything that would put
  an extra burden on the military personnel abroad who want to vote.''
  Gore then backed him up and the Democrats left the Republican
  strategy unchallenged.  See Berke (2001).}  They concluded that
``Under intense pressure from the Republicans, Florida officials
accepted hundreds of overseas absentee ballots that failed to comply
with the state laws'' (Barstow and Van Natta, Jr.,
2001)\nocite{BarVan01}.

Were these 680 inappropriately counted ballots enough to have thrown
the election to the wrong candidate?  The \emph{Times} hired us to
find out.  Our conclusions were presented as part of the story
(Barstow and Van Natta, Jr., 2001) and our methods were briefly
described in a sidebar (Barbanel, 2001)\nocite{Barbanel01}.  In this
paper, we discuss in detail the methods we developed for this project
so that others might use them for similar problems.  The problem is a
straightforward ecological inference: we observe the number of bad
ballots in each of Florida's counties and the number of ballots cast
and counted for each of the candidates.  From these variables, and a
variety of other auxiliary information, we try to infer the total
number of bad ballots that had been cast for each candidate and see
whether this is enough to make up for Bush's 537 official vote margin.

Since the partisan atmosphere surrounding public discourse on this
issue was so highly charged, we knew that our work would be subject to
more than the usual academic scrutiny, and so we sought a method that
was less vulnerable to criticism --- perhaps even, from a scholarly
perspective, somewhat unreasonable criticism.  No such statistical
method like this exists of course, especially for an area as uncertain
as ecological inference, but much can be done.  Our approach, in
addition to focusing on the bounds, is to introduce formal Bayesian
model averaging procedures to the ecological inference literature and
to include a wide range of models that even partisans might have
considered.  The procedure then computes a combined estimate from
these models based on their relative probability of being correct, as
indicated by the data.  So that others can use the methods we
introduce here to analyze other problems, we have included all methods
introduced here in the popular program \emph{EI: A Program for
  Ecological Inference} (available at \url{http://GKing.Harvard.edu}).

Our results give the exact probability that Gore would have won the
election if the law had been followed in this instance.  This
probability is small, but we know with mathematical certainty that it
is greater than zero --- a conclusion that can only be seen as
remarkable for the world's premier democracy.  Secondly, although our
analyses show that it is unlikely that illegal overseas absentee
ballots alone changed the outcome of the election, we show that Bush's
margin of victory would likely have been much narrower if those flawed
ballots had not been counted.  This supports the argument made by
\emph{The New York Times} that the flawed ballots favored Bush much
more than other candidates.  We also present here a variety of results
that did not appear in the \emph{Times} article, including the
probability that Gore would have won under various hypothetical
scenarios, such as if Katherine Harris had accepted Palm Beach
County's recount, which was submitted two hours late.  In some
plausible scenarios, the probability that Gore would have won is
nearly 100\%.  Finally, we present evidence that the propensity of
local election officials to violate the law and accept bad ballots was
substantially greater in counties where Bush strategists believed
there were more absentee ballot support for Bush and tried to convince
election officials to accept bad ballots.  This is consistent with the
\emph{Times}' thesis and evidence that these local election officials
bent to the will of Republican lobbists.

Section \ref{s:ballots} reviews the illegal overseas absentee ballots
in Florida and their importance in the course of events following the
election. It also provides the description of the data set we received
from \textit{The New York Times}.  Section \ref{s:ecinf} introduces
our statistical model, Bayesian modeling averaging, and our estimation
procedure.  Section \ref{s:outcome} discusses our substantive results.
Section \ref{s:concl} concludes.

\section{Invalid Overseas Absentee Ballots in Florida} \label{s:ballots}

On July 15, 2001, \textit{The New York Times} published an article,
``How Bush Took Florida: Mining the Overseas Absentee Vote,'' as the
result of its six-month investigation on the 2000 US election.  The
\emph{Times} reporters describe the details of the Bush campaign
effort to secure victory by pressuring selected local election
officials to count invalid overseas absentee ballots in Florida.  In
particular, Republicans focused on military ballots and the counties
where Bush had his strongest voting base.  For example, in counties
such as Escambia, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa, Bush lawyers argued that
every vote cast by Americans in uniform should be counted, regardless
of the letter of the law.  In counties more favorable to Democrats,
Bush's lawyers argued exactly the opposite --- that local election
officials must follow the letter of the law and disqualify any ballot
not meeting the rules.

According to the \emph{Times}, this unequal pressure led to unequal
treatment by local officials of citizens who cast their ballots from
overseas.  That partisans would pursue their interests creatively,
relentlessly, and even inconsistently in different places is neither a
novel claim nor remotely illegal.  That local election officials would
respond to this pressure by treating voters unequally is a more
serious claim.  The \emph{Times'} view --- ``The result was unequal
treatment of ballots with the same flaws.'' --- contradicts statements
by Florida Secretary of State, Katherine Harris, that the rules were
applied uniformly.  It also would seem to violate the Equal Protection
Clause of the U.S.\ Constitution, which was part of the stated grounds
under which the United States Supreme Court in \emph{Bush v.\ Gore}
stopped the manual recounts.

The 680 ballots that the \emph{Times} judged as flawed fell into one
or more of these categories (Barstow and Van Natta, Jr.,
2001):\footnote{For pictures of some of the bad ballots, see
  \url{http://www.nytimes.com/images/2001/07/15/politics/absentee/nat_ABSENTEE_count_index.html}.}
\begin{itemize}
\item 344 ballots had late, illegible or missing postmarks (postmarks
  must indicate that the ballot was cast on or before election day).
\item 183 ballots with United States postmarks.
\item 169 ballots were received from voters who were not registered,
  who had failed to sign the envelope, or who had not requested a
  ballot.
\item 96 ballots lacked the required signature or address of a witness
\item 19 voters cast two ballots, both of which counted.
\item 5 ballots were received after the Nov.\ 17 deadline but counted
  anyway.
\end{itemize}

If we knew for which candidate the illegal ballots were cast, we would
immediately know their effect on the election. However, the secret
ballot makes this impossible in most cases.  The secret ballot was
implemented in this case by separating the envelope, with all the
information above, from the ballot contained inside the envelope once
the latter was counted.  Thus, we only have access to these envelopes,
the county in which they were counted, and county-level data on the
number of bad ballots and the number of ballots cast for Gore and
Bush.

Table~\ref{tb:ballots} illustrates the estimation problem at the state
level. The question mark indicates the unknown quantities to be
estimated.  The table illustrates that while we know the aggregate
number of invalid and valid ballots as well as the total number of
votes each candidate obtained from overseas absentee voters, we do not
know their composition, which is the goal of the analysis.  Analogous
contingency tables also exist for each of the 67 Florida counties, and
the same ecological inference problem exists in each.
\begin{table}[t]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
      & Gore  & Bush & Others & total  \\
      \hline 
      invalid ballots &   ?   &   ?  &   ?    &  680   \\
      valid ballots   &   ?   &   ?  &   ?    & 1824   \\
      \hline
      & 836   & 1575 &   79   & 2504   \\
    \end{tabular} \caption{The Ecological Inference Problem in Florida.  
      ``?'' indicates the unknown quantities to be
      estimated.}\label{tb:ballots}
  \end{center}
\end{table} 

In addition to this contingency table for each county, we received
three other kinds of data for each county.  First, from voter
registration records, we have data about each overseas absentee voter,
including their sex, race, party registration, and whether they were
military personnel or civilian.  Second, for comparative purposes we
also have data available for election-day voters in the 67 counties.
Finally, the \emph{Times} also us provided indicator variables for
four regions in Florida and some other measures.  We use this extra
information in ways we describe below to improve our ecological
inferences.

\section{Ecological Inference for Flawed Ballots} \label{s:ecinf}

Table~\ref{tb:ei} presents our formal notation.  For each county $i$
($i=1,\dots,67$), we denote the proportion of invalid ballots among
all overseas absentee ballots as $X_i$, and the total number of
overseas absentee ballots which were counted as $N_i$.  We also let
Gore's proportion of the vote be $T_i$.  To simplify presentation, we
combine the votes for Bush and the other minor candidates as Bush
votes. (Although our presentation always involves only the Bush/Gore
choice, our empirical results using deterministic bounds in Section
\ref{s:noassump} includes the possibility of bad ballots having been
cast for minor party candidates.  We handle minor parties in our
statistical analyses in Section \ref{s:stat} by ignoring the problem
at first and then conducting sensitivity analyses; since votes for
minor party candidates only total 3 percent, we find, as expected,
that they have a very small effect on the overall result.  Other
analyses (not shown) using more computationally intensive techniques
designed to model these choices separately confirm these results (see
Rosen et al., 2001)\nocite{RosJaiKin01}.)  Each of these quantities
are observed.  We denote unobserved quantities with Greek letters.
Thus, the proportions of invalid and valid ballots cast for Gore are
$\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$, respectively.
\begin{table}[t]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
                & Gore  & Bush &         \\
\hline 
invalid ballots & $\bb_i$  & $1-\bb_i$ & $X_i$   \\
valid ballots   & $\bg_i$  & $1-\bg_i$ & $1-X_i$ \\
\hline
                & $T_i$ & $1-T_i$ &         \\
\end{tabular} \caption{Ecological inference for invalid overseas
  absentee ballots in Florida}\label{tb:ei}
\end{center}
\end{table} 

Although $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ are used for the estimation, our ultimate
quantity of interest is Bush's margin after dropping the invalid
absentee ballots.  To define this quantity, first define the statewide
fraction of bad ballots that went to Gore as the weighted average of
the individual county quantities:
\begin{equation}
  \bb=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{67}N_i\bb_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{67}N_i},
\end{equation}
so that we then have
\begin{align}
  \text{Bush's margin} & = \text{official margin}
  - [\text{Bush's bad ballots} - \text{Gore's bad ballots}] \notag\\
  & = 537 - [(1-\bb)680-\bb 680]\notag\\
  & = 1360 \bb - 143. \label{qoi}
\end{align}
Once we estimate this quantity, we can also estimate the probability
of Gore's victory, $\Pr(\text{Bush's margin}<0)$, which is another
quantity of interest.  (Note that $\bg_i$ is not used in Equation
\ref{qoi} but is necessary as an ancillary parameter during
estimation.)

\subsection{Analysis Without Statistical Assumptions} \label{s:noassump}

The relationship among the parameters in Table~\ref{tb:ei} can be
represented by the accounting identity
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gid}
  T_i=\bb_i X_i+\bg_i (1-X_i).
\end{equation} 
This equation is an identity generated by the aggregation process, and
therefore always holds and has no stochastic term.  Furthermore, we
note that this accounting identity implies a deterministic linear
relationship between the two unknown parameters,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:identity}
\bg_i = \frac{T_i}{1-X_i}-\frac{X_i}{1-X_i}\bb_i,
\end{equation}
which traces out what \citet{king:97} calls a tomography line.  In
addition, before we observe $X_i$ and $T_i$ in any county, we also
know that $\bb_i\in[0,1]$ and $\bg_i\in[0,1]$.

Once we observe $X_i$ and $T_i$, we can narrow the bounds further
(simply by projecting the line in Equation \ref{eq:identity} to the
two axes).  Thus, without any statistical assumptions, we can derive
the upper and lower bounds of $\bg_i$ and $\bb_i$ for each county $i$,
which in turn implies the bounds for our quantity of interest, Bush's
margin after dropping flawed overseas absentee ballots.

Table~\ref{tb:bounds} shows how the analysis of bounds can be very
powerful in some situations. For example, Escambia is one of the
counties where many invalid ballots were found. At the same time, this
county is one of Bush's strongholds: about 76 percent of overseas
absentee ballots for this county were counted for Bush. The analysis
of bounds shows that the minimum number of invalid ballots cast for
Bush was as high as 48 votes while that for Gore is zero. Thus we know
that at least 19 percent of invalid ballots belong to Bush rather than
Gore.  Santa Rosa County is similar: Out of the total of 55 flawed
absentee ballots, at least 37 votes were cast for Bush.  Finally,
Baker County illustrates why sometimes the ``secret ballot'' is not
really secret.  In this county, only one absentee ballot was cast and
also was found to be invalid. Hence, we know from the total tally of
absentee ballots in this county --- one vote for Bush --- that this
person voted for Bush and that it was an invalid ballot but included
in the official count.  (In fact, the name, address, and individual
vote cast of all people in counties, like Baker, that cast all their
overseas absentee ballots for one candidate, are on the public record.
This is because the bounds have zero width whenever either $X_i$ or
$T_i$ is zero or one.)
\begin{table}[t]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l c |ccc|ccc}
  & \bf Total   & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{\bf Gore's votes} &
  \multicolumn{3}{c}{\bf Bush's votes} \\
  & invalid & official & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{invalid ballots} & official &
  \multicolumn{2}{c}{invalid ballots} \\
County & ballots & counts & minimum & maximum & counts & minimum & maximum \\
\hline 
Escambia   & 102 & 47 & 0 & 47 & 154 & 48 & 102 \\
Santa Rosa &  55 & 16 & 0 & 16 &  65 & 37 &  55 \\
Baker      &   1 &  0 & 0 &  0 &   1 &  1 &   1 \\
\hline
\bf all counties & \bf 680 & \bf 836 & \bf 5 & \bf 527 & \bf 1575 & \bf 128 & \bf 668 \\ 
\end{tabular} \caption{Analysis of bounds for the state  and 
  selected counties.  Votes for minor parties are included in the
  calculation of these bounds.}\label{tb:bounds}
\end{center}
\end{table} 

From these county level bounds, we can derive the aggregate bounds for
the total number of invalid ballots for each candidate at the state
level. The result shows that at least 8 percent, or 128 votes of
Bush's 1,575 absentee ballots, should not have been counted, whereas
for Gore the minimum number of invalid ballots is only 5 out of his
total 836 votes (0.6 percent).  Furthermore, it is possible that Bush
could have inappropriately benefited from up to 668 out of the 680
invalid ballots.

The most significant conclusion from this analysis is that we cannot
exclude the possibility that Gore actually won the election.  That is,
without making any assumptions other than that the \emph{Times} coding
decisions were correct (and again, we saw no objection to them in the
media discussion that followed their story), the 537 Bush margin now
changes to somewhere from a 126 vote victory for Gore to a 936 vote
victory for Bush.  Once the ballots were removed from the envelopes,
America forever gave up the possibility of knowing for certain who won
the 2000 election.

\subsection{Statistical Modeling} \label{s:stat}

In order to learn more about who actually won the election --- the
margins of victory within the bounds that are most likely --- we must
add some statistical assumptions.  With these assumptions, we can make
precise probabilistic statements about our quantities of interest.
Readers might not agree with us that the assumptions we chose are
plausible, or even the best possible, but the price of the more
precise conclusions that follow is the additional uncertainty owing to
the conclusions being conditional on the assumptions.  Of course this
is the situation with almost any model-based statistical analysis, but
we try to avoid some of these problems by using Bayesian model
averaging.

While confidence intervals and standard errors in most statistical
models include estimation uncertainty, they do not usually include
uncertainty due to model choice.  This is especially problematic since
analysts rarely have a strong theory to justify their model choice.
Bayesian model averaging is a formal statistical methodology that
incorporates model uncertainty into the estimation.\footnote{See
  \citet{hoet:madi:raft:voli:99} for an introduction to Bayesian model
  averaging in the general case.  \citet{drap:95} discusses how
  Bayesian model averaging deals with the model uncertainty.
  \citet{bart:97} is a political science application that uses an
  approximation to formal Bayesian model averaging procedures.} It
more naturally allows one to consider a wider range of models, while
still producing one set of results.  It also overcomes some of the
uncertainty due to model choice by averaging different models and
weighting them according to how much support each model receives from
the data.

Ecological inferences about bad ballots in Florida is an especially
good application of Bayesian model averaging methodology for the
following reasons.  First, model assumptions can play a critical role
in ecological inference when the bounds are wide.  In addition to
sensitivity to model specification, an inherent feature of the
ecological inference problem is weak
identification.\footnote{Including multiple covariates uncorrelated
  with $X_i$ cause no identification problems in ecological inference.
  Ecological inference models that do not incorporate information from
  the deterministic bounds (such as in Goodman
  (1953)\nocite{goodman53}) are not identified when including $X_i$ or
  variables related to $X_i$ as covariates (King, 1997: 42).  Thus, to
  the extent that ecological inference models that incorporate the
  bounds, such as King's (1997), are estimable when including $X_i$ or
  covariates that are related to $X_i$, the information that makes
  this possible is coming from the bounds.  Hence, weak identification
  with multiple covariates in modern ecological inference models
  occurs primarly when both the data have relatively uninformative
  bounds and the model includes one or more covariates that are
  correlated with $X_i$.}  A consequence is that one cannot always use
models with as many covariates as are available to analyze ecological
data because such models are often not identified.  On the other hand,
if we have many covariates to predict individual behavior, it makes
sense that we should be able to improve our inferences by using them.
After all, more data should be better in this area as it is in every
other.  Our application of Bayesian model averaging reduces this
problem by letting analysts combine many small models with the full
range of covariates.

Bayesian model averaging was especially important here since political
scientists have only rarely studied absentee ballots and we therefore
have little prior theory with which to assist in model specification.
The procedure thus enables us to conduct an analysis without having to
defend one particular specification, or even a small set of
specifications.  We can, and did, include any specification in the
analysis that we or anyone we discussed the matter with thought might
be relevant.

\subsubsection{Ecological Inference}

We now give a brief qualitative overview of King's (1997) models of
ecological inference \nocite{king:97} and their assumptions in the
context of our overseas absentee ballot analysis.  These models have
come to called EI, after the software that implements them.  We then
explain the Bayesian model averaging procedure and the logic behind it
and show how to incorporate this methodology into EI.
Appendix~\ref{appx:king} gives technical details.

We begin by thinking about the data in terms of the \emph{possible}
values of the ($\bg_i,\bb_i$) points for each county as line segments
(defined by Equation \ref{eq:identity}) in the tomography plot in
Figure~\ref{fg:tomog}.  Any possible values of the two parameters for
each county has to lie on the portion of its own tomography line that
falls within the unit square.  Without any further assumptions, this
is all the information that exists about our quantities of interest.
In a sense, then, Figure \ref{fg:tomog} presents the data in the form
closest to the answers we seek.
\begin{figure}[t]
  \vspace{-1in}\hspace{0.5in}
  \begin{minipage}[c]{6.5in}
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=4.5in,height=6in,angle=-90]{tomog}
    \end{center}
  \end{minipage}
  \caption{\label{fg:tomog}
    Tomography plot for invalid overseas absentee ballots.  $\bb$ and
    $\bg$ are the proportion of Gore's invalid and valid ballots,
    respectively.  Each line traces out the possible values of the
    $\bb_i,\bg_i$ point for each county $i$.}
\end{figure}
% \begin{figure}[t]
% \begin{center}
% \includegraphics[width=4.5in,height=6in,angle=-90]{tomog}
% \caption{\label{fg:tomog}
%   Tomography plot for invalid overseas absentee ballots.  $\bb$ and
%   $\bg$ are the proportion of Gore's invalid and valid ballots,
%   respectively.  Each line traces out the possible values of the
%   $\bb_i,\bg_i$ point for each county $i$.}
% \end{center} 
% \end{figure}

We then add three assumptions, all conditional on $X$ and a set of
covariates $Z$.  First, we assume that $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ follow a
truncated bivariate normal distribution, with truncation on the unit
square.  The idea here is that whatever the values of the unknown
parameters from Florida's 67 counties on their respective tomography
lines, they all have something in common, and that any systematic
difference between them will be picked up by covariates.  The main
constraint of this assumption is that the bivariate density is
unimodal and that it is constrained to the [0,1] interval in both
directions.

The second assumption is that the absence of residual spatial
correlation in $T$ after taking into account $X$ and $Z$.  King's
ecological inference model has not been shown to be very sensitive to
anything but extreme levels of spatial autocorrelation, but we make
this assumption even more plausible by including tests with covariates
that tap into Florida's regions and other spatial features.

The final assumption states that the two unknown quantities, $\bb_i$
and $\bg_i$, are independent of $X_i$, given $Z$.  For example, if the
\textit{The New York Times} reporters are correct that bad ballots
were cast disproportionately for Bush in Bush counties, then we should
find a strong relationship between $\bb_i$ and variables that measure
Bush support.

Each of these three assumptions can be modified to any degree by the
inclusion of different covariates.  We rely on this point to produce a
diverse array of models to which we then apply Bayesian model
averaging.

\subsubsection{Bayesian Model Averaging}

In Bayesian inference, we are interested in the posterior distribution
which we obtain through the application of Bayes theorem:
\begin{equation}
  \P(\Theta|T) \propto \P(\Theta)\P(T|\Theta).\label{eq:post}
\end{equation}
where $\P(\Theta)$ is the prior probability distribution on some
unknown parameter $\Theta$, and $\P(T|\Theta)$ is the likelihood
(which in our case is given in Equation~\ref{eq:likelihood}).
Everything is conditioned on $X$, $N$, and $Z$, which we observe. We
use the standard independent prior on each parameter of $\Theta$ as
described in section 7.4 of \citet{king:97}.  This prior distribution
and the likelihood function together define King's model in a standard
Bayesian framework.

Along with $T_i$, $X_i$ and $N_i$, we have 27 other variables
including race, sex, and party registration for the overseas absentee
voters as well as county level election and demographic data.  We
define 27 models, each using one of these 27 variables as the
covariate.  We also include a model with no covariates and 3 models
with $X_i$ as the covariate for the mean of $\bb$, $\bg$, and for
both.  For each model, we use the same independent prior distribution
as explained above. The idea of Bayesian model averaging is to produce
one set of results combining these 31 models according to how much
support each model receives from the data.\footnote{\label{f:models}A
  list of all 31 models follows: (1) no covariate, (2) $X_i$ for
  $\bb$, (3) $X_i$ for $\bg$, (4) $X_i$ for both $\bb$ and $\bg$, (5)
  military absentee voters, (6) registered Republican absentee voters,
  (7) registered Democratic absentee voters, (8) female absentee
  voters, (9) White absentee voters, (10) Black absentee voters, (11)
  Hispanic absentee voters, (12) rejected military absentee voters,
  (13) rejected registered Republican absentee voters, (14) rejected
  registered Democratic absentee voters, (15) rejected female absentee
  voters, (16) rejected White absentee voters, (17) rejected Black
  absentee voters, (18) rejected Hispanic absentee voters, (19)
  Democratic vote share among residents, (20) vote share of Republican
  candidates, (21) vote share of other candidates, (22) registered
  Democratic residents, (23) registered Republican residents,
  registered Black Democratic residents, (24) proportion of voting age
  population not registered, (25) Black registered Democrats, (26)
  Black registered Republican residents, (27) acceptance ratio of
  overall absentee ballots, (28) ratio of invalid absentee ballots,
  (29) Panhandl Florida regional indicator variable, (30) Southern
  Florida regional indicator variable, (31) corruption indicator. All
  the covariates except indicator variables are entered as a ratio
  varying from 0 to 1.  Except the first three models, the covariate
  was used to model the conditional untruncted mean of both
  parameters, $\bb$ and $\bg$.  Models (5) to (11) are based on
  information about the absentee ballots and so different variables
  were available regarding the invalid and valid ballots; we used the
  former group to predict $\bb$ and the latter to predict $\bg$.}

Let $M_k$ denote the $k$th model specification ($k=1,\dots,31$). Then
we make an inference about some quantity of interest $\Delta$ by
computing its posterior distribution via Bayesian model averaging.  To
do this, we first compute, for each of the 31 models, the posterior
distribution of $\Delta$ (computed from Equation \ref{eq:post} with
$\Delta$ being some known function of $\Theta$): $\P(\Delta|M_k,T)$.
Then we average over these models by weighting by the relative
posterior probability that each model is correct given the data,
$\Pr(M_k|T)$:
\begin{align} \label{eq:bma}
  \Pr(\Delta|T) &= \sum_{k=1}^{31} \P(\Delta,M_k|T)\notag\\
                &= \sum_{k=1}^{31} \P(\Delta|M_k,T) \Pr(M_k|T)
\end{align}
where the posterior model probability is computed as
\begin{equation}
  \Pr(M_k|T)=\frac{\P(T|M_k)\Pr(M_k)}
             {\sum_{j=1}^{31} \Pr(T|M_j) \Pr(M_j)}.  \label{eq:postmodel}
\end{equation}
This is the probability that model $k$ is correct, given the set of
models in the analysis; it should not be confused with $R^2$-like
measures which typically reward models that overfit without
distinguishing systematic from idiosyncratic features of the data.

To compute the posterior model probability, we need two elements.
First is a prior probability that each model is correct, $\Pr(M_k)$.
For simplicity, we assign an equal prior probability, $1/31$, to each
model.  This at least does not given any a priori advantage to one
model over another.  (Section \ref{s:sens} discusses sensitivity to
priors.)

The other quantity we need to compute for the posterior model
probability is the marginal likelihood, $\P(T|M_k)$, which is
\begin{equation}
  \P(T|M_k) = \int \P(T|\Theta_k, M_k) \P(\Theta_k|M_k) d\Theta_k,
  \label{eq:marglik}
\end{equation} 
where $\P(\Theta_j|M_j)$ is the prior distribution for the parameter
vector $\Theta$ in Model $k$. That is, the marginal likelihood is
obtained by averaging the likelihood over the prior distribution.  The
marginal likelihood can be thought of as ``the probability of seeing
the data that actually were observed, calculated \emph{before} any
data became available'' \cite[p.776]{kass:raft:95}.  That is, instead
of maximizing the likelihood with respect to the parameter given the
data, as we would do to compute the maximum likelihood estimate, the
marginal likelihood does not have a maximization step: it is the
average value of the likelihood evaluated at parameter values drawn
from their prior density.  (Although this quantity could be computed
by simulation in this way, such a method tends to be highly
inefficient, especially for problems with relatively flat priors or
high dimensional parameter vectors.  We discuss these and other
computational issues in the Appendix.)\footnote{Estimates obtained via
  Bayesian model averaging are also known to provide better
  predictions under certain widely applicable conditions than using
  any of the individual component models \citep{madi:raft:94}.  This
  result is similar to insights from the closely related literature on
  committee methods \citep{bish:95}, although suprisingly the
  literatures have relatively few cross-citations.  See also Rosen,
  Jiang, and Tanner (2000) and Robert
  (1996)\nocite{rose:jian:tann:00,robe:96a}.}

\section{Empirical Results}
\label{s:outcome}

\subsection{The Probability That Gore Would Have Won Without Bad 
Absentee Ballots}

Figure \ref{fg:margin} portrays the posterior distribution from our
analysis of Bush's margin of victory if the bad ballots had not been
counted (the histogram of 1000 draws from the posterior).  Note first
that, as required by the procedure, all area for this distribution is
contained with the bounds we found for this quantity of $-126$ to 936.
The weight of the statistical evidence within these bounds clearly
demonstrates that Bush benefited considerably by the bad ballots, and
removing them thus takes away from his margin.  This is evident in the
figure because almost all of the area of the histogram of posterior
probability falls to the left of the official margin of 537.  The mean
margin of victory for Bush without the bad ballots is only 251 votes.
The figure also portrays the probability that Gore actually won the
election by the area under the curve to the left of zero.  This is
only about 0.2 percent, indicating that Gore probably would not have
won, even if the bad ballots had been discarded.

  680 invalid overseas absentee ballots} \label{fg:margin}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

\subsection{Other Counterfactuals}

While our results indicate that it is unlikely that invalid overseas
absentee ballots alone would have changed the election outcome, the
illegally counted ballots could have had a much more a significant
effect when combined with slight changes in decisions regarding the
manual recounts.  We show this result by first focusing on several
scenarios about the two key counties where a manual recount was
conducted, Miami Dade and Palm Beach. In Miami Dade County, election
officials decided to stop the manual recount when they made the
judgment that they could not meet the recount deadline, set by the
Florida Supreme Court, 5p.m.  Sunday, November 27.  The partial manual
recount gave a net gain of 157 votes to Gore. In Palm Beach county,
they also could not finish the manual recount, but they submitted the
result of the partial recount just before the deadline, which would
have given Gore a net gain of 192 votes for Gore. Later that day, Palm
Beach electoral officials reported the result of the complete recount
to Harris.  She rejected this complete recount as well as the partial
recount and did not include them in the certified official tally,
thereby denying Gore a total of 349 votes \nocite{purd:00}(Purdum,
2000).

  \end{minipage}
\end{table}

The panel of Table~\ref{tb:senario} marked ``actual recounts''
presents our prediction for Bush's margin and Gore's probability of
victory in situations where the invalid overseas absentee ballots had
been rejected \emph{and} the recounts in one or both of these counties
had been included in the final tally.  For example, if the recounted
votes in Miami Dade and Palm Beach had all been counted, Gore would
have won with a 0.82 probability, with the uncertainty in this number
coming only from our analysis of the bad overseas absentee ballots.
If only the Palm Beach votes had been counted, Gore would have won
with 0.29 probability.  To put it another way, the massive differences
in the probabilities from 0.002 to 0.82 for a Gore victory were all
due to the decisions of Katherine Harris.

In the last panel of Table \ref{tb:senario}, we consider
counterfactuals where the invalid overseas absentee ballots had not
been counted and election day voting recounts had occurred in various
ways, as suggested by a study conducted by a consortium of media
organizations (Fessenden and Broder, 2001).  For example, this
analysis shows that if the U.S.\ Supreme Court had not stopped the
recount in \emph{Bush v.\ Gore}, the victor would have changed with
only a 1\% probability.  However, if Gore's formal request that
Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and Voulusia counties be recounted
had been granted, then he would have been elected with a 73\%
probability.  If the entire state had been recounted, according to
almost any standard for judging the punch cards, Gore would have won
election with a very high probability.

\subsection{Indirect Evidence of Local Election Officials Responding
  to Republican Pressure}

Six months of interviews and archival research on the ground in
Florida and elsewhere led reporters from the \emph{New York Times}
to conclude that, ``the Republicans mounted a legal and public
relations campaign to persuade canvassing boards in Bush strongholds
to waive the state's election laws when counting overseas absentee
ballots.\ldots Their goal was simple: to count the maximum number of
overseas ballots in counties won by Mr.  Bush, particularly those with
a high concentration of military voters, while seeking to disqualify
overseas ballots in counties won by Vice President Al Gore.''  The
\emph{Times} claimed that as a direct result of this pressure,
``canvassing boards in about a dozen Republican-leaning counties had
reconvened for a second round of counting.  In each place,
longstanding election rules were bent and even ignored.  Boards
counted ballots postmarked as many as seven days after the election,
including some from within the United States.  They counted two
ballots sent by fax.  Officials in Santa Rosa County even counted five
ballots that arrived after the Nov.\ 17 deadline.  Again and again,
election officials crossed out the words `REJECTED AS ILLEGAL' that
had been stamped on ballot envelopes.''

If these claims are correct, we ought to be able to find evidence of
them in our data.  We conduct two tests.  In the first, we divide
Florida's counties into three categories --- the six counties
mentioned explicitly in the \emph{Times} story where the Republicans
pressured officials to count illegal ballots, the four counties
mentioned where Republicans pressured local election officials not to
count the ballots, and the remaining counties which were not
mentioned.  We then compute various statistics for these three
categories and present them for comparison in Table \ref{t:cty}.  (The
results in this table were not available to the reporters before their
article appeared and so Table \ref{t:cty} does represent an
independent test.)

\end{table}

The evidence strikingly supports the \emph{Times'} account of events.
The first two columns of Table \ref{t:cty} report on the
characteristics of the county, information available to Republican
strategists before they started lobbying.  With the exception of two
counties with very few absentee ballots, the counties identified as
areas where the Republicans focused their efforts to count ballots
were those with large populations of military personnel and Republican
voters.  Similarly, the counties the \emph{Times} identified as
places where Republicans discouraged the ballots from being counted
had consistently fewer military personnel and Republican voters.

The result of the Republican efforts also appears to have been
successful.  A larger fraction of bad ballots were counted in all
counties where Republicans tried to get them counted than the average,
and a smaller fraction than the average were counted in every county
where the Republicans tried to have them not counted.  
The fraction of bad ballots accepted that had been cast for Bush also
supports the same theory: Fewer of the counted bad ballots had been
Bush voters when the Republicans tried not to have ballots counted
than in every county where the Republicans tried to have them counted.

The \emph{Times'} report also helps explain some interesting
variations in this table.  First, we would have expected more Bush
votes among the bad ballots than we found in Duval County because it
had so many military personnel.  However, the \emph{Times} reported
that an election official on the Duval County canvassing board ``held
the line on counting ballots with missing postmarks.''  Similarly,
Pasco County has relatively low numbers of military ballots and a
small Republican vote share.  So we might expect that this county to
have had relatively few of the bad ballots being cast for Bush.
However, the story also described the unusually strong Republican
pressure applied in this county: ```It looks to me like we've got a
lot of pressure here,' Judge Robert P.  Cole, chairman of the Pasco
board, said as he faced a throng of cheering Republicans and more than
a dozen Bush representatives [and no officials from the Gore
campaign].''  Our quantitative results are certainly consistent with
this qualitative evidence.

We also look for indirect evidence of local election officials
succumbing to pressure from Republican Party officials by examining
which component models in the Bayesian model averaging procedure were
found to have the highest posterior probability.  Table~\ref{tb:bma}
gives the top six such models listed in order.  Generally, if the
\emph{Times'} hypothesis is right, we would expect that the covariates
that have the biggest effects would be related to where
Republicans tried hardest to influence local officials.  If they were
as rational and deliberate as the \emph{Times} indicated, these would
be counties where they expected the largest numbers of bad ballots
that, if counted, would help Bush's cause.  Obviously, we have no such
variable, but there are a variety of variables related to this.  In
the top six, two have the largest effects and both are consistent with
the theory: The more absentee voters registered as Republicans, and the
more white absentee voters in a district, the more bad ballots
were cast for Bush (the negative sign indicating that Bush's lead is
reduced when these ballots are not counted).  The other covariates
have comparatively small effects.

\label{tb:bma}
\end{center}
\end{table}

The large variation in our prediction for Bush's margin across the six
models in Table~\ref{tb:bma} emphasizes a clear advantage of our
Bayesian model averaging procedure.  The variation results from the
large degree of model dependence in these data (because the data have
fairly wide bounds).  For example, the specification with white
absentee voters gives a confidence interval which, when considered in
isolation from the other models, would not enable us to reject the
hypothesis that Gore won if only the overseas absentee ballots had
been rejected.  This is obviously quite different from our overall
result of only a 0.2 percent probability that Gore won.  Since
different specifications yield very different inferences, an analyst
having to choose one model would be in the untenable position of
having to defend choices without a lot of prior evidence.  Bayesian
model averaging offers a way around this common problem.  Instead of
results jumping dramatically from one specification to the next,
results in Bayesian model averaging do not change as much when new
models are added to the specification, unless they have especially
large probabilities of being true.

Finally, we give a summary of some of the diagnostics we used to check
the fit of the model.  First, we reran each model with different
starting values to verify that we found the global maximum in each
case.  We also examined each the tomography plots with contours or
confidence intervals to search for outliers or bad model fits.  In
addition, we plotted $E(T|X)$ or $E(T|X,Z)$ by $X$ or $Z$, and checked
whether the observed $T$ fell within the (say) 90\% confidence
interval 90\% of the time.

We also look at whether the first stage of the model (i.e., before
conditioning on $T_i$) fits by comparing the county-level posterior
predictive confidence interval for $T_i$ to its observed value.
Figure \ref{fg:fit} gives several examples of this strategy for two of
the models we ran (in the first two rows), as well as for the ultimate
model implied by the entire Bayesian model averaging procedure (in the
last row).  The first column plots these predictive confidence
intervals by $X_i$, the fraction of bad ballots.  The second column
plots the same intervals by the covariate included.  The proportion of
observed $T_i$ points falling inside the 80\% confidence intervals is
always approximately 80\%, which is one check on model fit.  Another
is the lack of any noticeable relationship between the degree to which
the observed $T_i$ deviates from the center of the conference interval
and the variable plotted on the horizontal axis.  All these
diagnostics, and other similar graphs we examined, seem to confirm the
fit of the model to these data.

  Bayesian model averaging.  Dots represent the true values of $T_i$

\subsection{The Minor Effects of Minor Candidates and Prior Densities} 
\label{s:sens}

Finally, we analyze the effects on our results of ignoring the minor
party candidates and also study the sensitivity of our results to our
choices for model priors.  Figure~\ref{fg:sensitivity} plots the
posterior distribution of Bush's new margin without invalid overseas
absentee ballots for different model specifications for comparison
with our posterior distribution.  The solid line in this figure is an
alternative specification of the ecological inference model where we
combine the votes for the minor candidates together with those for
Gore rather than with the votes for Bush, resulting in 31 new
individual models corresponding to the 31 models already run.  The
posterior distribution for this model is very similar to the results
of our previous analysis indicating that our results do not depend on
which model specification is used.
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in,height=4.5in,angle=-90]{sensitivity}
\caption{Sensitivity analysis of Bayesian model
  averaging. The histogram is the posterior distribution of Bush's new
  margin for our model, while the other lines give posterior
  distributions from different models and prior specifications.}
\label{fg:sensitivity}
\end{center} 
\end{figure}

The other two lines represent the use of different prior distributions
for the coefficients of the covariate of each model.  We use different
prior standard deviations for the coefficients of the covariates to
see if the results are sensitive to the choice of the prior
distribution.  While some feature of the posterior do vary across
specifications, the graph shows that model results are not
particularly sensitive to the prior specification.  The median
posterior point in particular is hardly changed across the models.

\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{s:concl}

Counterfactual analysis is normally very difficult, and especially so
when the subject of the inference is far from the factual evidence.
When the counterfactual is very close to the data, however, we stand
an especially good chance of making valid inferences (King and Zeng,
2001; Lebow, 2000)\nocite{KinZen01,Lebow00}.  The counterfactuals in
the case of Florida are especially clear and easily could have
happened, which makes the results of this case study somewhat more
certain than usual.  If the problem of the overseas absentee ballots
had been litigated and the law applied equally in every county (as
\emph{Bush v.\ Gore} required of the votes cast on election day), the
bad ballots might very well have been disqualified.  In this
situation, although Gore probably would have lost, we conclude that no
one will ever be able to say with certainty who would have won the
American presidential election if all American laws had been followed.
If also the Florida Secretary of State had somewhat different views on
issues that were at least somewhat open to discretion, the outcome of
the election might very well have changed.  Of course, a few different
decisions by the candidates on visits to Florida, campaign spending,
Elian Gonzalos, or any of a variety of other issues might also have
produced a different outcome.

Our results also provide strong, independent, but indirect support for
the thesis that local election officials bent to the persuasive
efforts of Republican strategists to follow the law in Gore counties
and break it in Bush areas.

Finally, we think this paper also provides an especially good example
of the use of Bayesian model averaging.  We have developed the
application of it to the ecological inference model and offer computer
code for others to use it.  In applied work, Bayesian model averaging
has been approximated, such as with the BIC, but its full version has
not seen as much use as it could.

Bayesian model averaging is a clear improvement on the usual situation
of having to select and defend a single model, but it is of course not
a panecia. A researcher never knows whether all relevant models have
been included and, although its results are more robust than
single-model approaches, it is always possible to come up with a
different list of models and produce a different substantive result.
And so in the end, and as always, the investigator's judgment always
plays an important role in making inferences.  Model averaging cannot
substitute for judgment, but it can help account for model
uncertainties where prior knowledge is not available. Furthermore, in
the present case, where 100\% confidence intervals are available (in
the form of bounds on the parameters), we also have additional
constraints on possible results.

\section{Technical Issues in Modeling and Estimation} \label{appx:king}

King's (1997) ecological inference model assumes that the joint
distribution of $\bg$ and $\bb$ is truncated bivariate normal with
mean $\bbetau=\{\bbetau^{\text{bad}},\bbetau^{\text{good}}\}$
and variance matrix $\Sigmau$:
\begin{equation}
\P(\bb_i, \bg_i | \bbetau, \Sigmau)  = 
 \N (\bb_i, \bg_i | \bbetau, \Sigmau)
\frac{\mathbf{1}(\bb_i, \bg_i \in [0,1])}
{R(\bbetau, \Sigmau)},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{1}$ is the indicator function, $\N (\bb_i, \bg_i |
\bbetau, \Sigmau) = (2 \pi)^{-1/2} |\Sigmau|^{-1/2} \text{exp} \{ -
\frac{1}{2} (\beta_i-\bbetau)^T \Sigmau^{-1} (\beta_i - \bbetau) \}$,
and $R (\bbetau, \Sigmau) = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \N (\bb, \bg | \bbetau,
\Sigmau) d\bb d\bg$.

This distributional assumption together with the accounting identity
in Equation \ref{eq:gid} determines the likelihood for the observed
data, $T_i$, which is
\begin{equation}
  \P(\Theta|T) \propto \prod_{i=1}^{67} N(T_i|\mu_i, \sigma_i^2)
  \frac{S(\bbetau, \Sigmau)}{R(\bbetau, \Sigmau)}, \label{eq:likelihood}
\end{equation}
where $\Theta=\{\bbetau,\Sigmau\}$ is a vector of all parameters to be
estimated,
\begin{equation}
  S(\bbetau, \Sigmau)=\int_{\text{max}(0,\thinspace T_i/X_i-(1-X_i)/X_i)}
  ^{\text{min}(1,T_i/X_i)} \N(\bb|\bbetau^b + \omega_i \epsilon_i /
  \sigma_i,\thinspace \sigmau^2_b-\omega^2/\sigma^2_i)d\bb,
\end{equation}
$\Eu(T_i|X_i)\equiv\mu_i = \bbetau^{\text{bad}} X_i +
\bbetau^{\text{good}} (1-X_i)$, and
$\Vu(T_i|X_i)\equiv\sigma^2_i=\sigmau_g + 2(\sigmau_{bg} - 2
\sigmau_g^2) X_i + (\sigmau_b^2 + \sigmau_g^2 - 2\sigmau_{bg}) X_i^2$.

Before adding covariates, we reparameterize for estimation as
$\phi_1=(\bbetau^b-0.5)/(\sigmau_b^2+0.25)$,
$\phi_2=(\bbetau^g-0.5)/(\sigmau_g^2+0.25)$,
$\phi_3=\text{ln}\sigmau_b$, $\phi_4=\text{ln}\sigmau_g$, and
$\phi_5=0.5\text{ln}\{(1+\rho)/(1-\rho)\}$.  For all but one model we
also control for covariates
$Z_i=\{Z_i^{\text{bad}},Z_i^{\text{good}}\}$ via King's (1997: Ch.\ 9)
extended model.  This allows the mean (on the untruncated scale) of
the two unknown parameters $(\bb_i, \bg_i)$ to be a function of these
covariates:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bbetau_i^b & = & [\phi_1 (\sigmau^2_b + 0.25) + 0.5] + (Z_i^{\text{bad}} -
\bar{Z}_i^{\text{bad}}) \alpha^{\text{bad}} \\
\bbetau_i^g & = & [\phi_1 (\sigmau^2_g + 0.25) + 0.5] + (Z_i^{\text{good}} -
\bar{Z}_i^{\text{good}}) \alpha^{\text{good}},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha^{\text{good}}$ and $\alpha^{\text{bad}}$ are now
additional parameters to be estimated and $\bar{Z}_i^{\text{good}}$
and $\bar{Z}_i^{\text{bad}}$ are means of the covariate vectors.  This
extension of the model relaxes the assumptions of mean independence,
no spatial autocorrelation, and truncated bivariate normality, and
replaces them with assumptions that are now conditional on the two
sets of covariates.  This also allows for the possibility of including
$X_i$ as a covariate, which is not possible in prior approaches.  Our
prior specification follows the recommendations of King (1997: Ch.\ 
7)\nocite{king:97}.

From one application of one specification of this model, we compute
the posterior density of a quantity of interest $\Delta$ by drawing it
from its posterior, $\P(\Delta|M_k,T)$.  To do this, we draw
simulations of $\bb$ and $\bg$ from their posterior and calculate
simulations of $\Delta$.  By applying this procedure to each of the 31
models, we get the first of the two components of Equation
\ref{eq:bma} needed for Bayesian model averaging.  The difficult part
of computing the second piece is the computation of the marginal
likelihood.  In particular, the integration in Equation
\ref{eq:marglik} is difficult, especially when the prior on the
parameters is relatively flat. A number of estimators have been
proposed to improve the precision of the estimation of the marginal
likelihood (see \citet{kass:raft:95} for a comprehensive survey).

To compute the marginal likelihood, we use the Laplace approximation,
\begin{equation}
  \P(T|M_k) \approx (2 \pi)^{{d_k}/2}|\widehat V(\hat\Theta_k)|^{1/2}
  \P(T|\hat{\Theta}_k) \P(\hat{\Theta}_k),
\end{equation}
where, for Model $k$, $\hat{\Theta}_k$ is the posterior mode, $\hat
V(\hat\Theta_k)$ is minus the inverse Hessian of the posterior
evaluated at the mode, and $d_k$ is the number of parameters.  The
Laplace approximation is known to perform well compared with other
methods
\citep{raft:96,lewi:raft:97,dici:kass:raft:wass:97}.\footnote{If a
  model is estimated through a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
  simulation, one can construct an algorithm where the chain visits
  each model stochastically so that you can compute the posterior
  model probability as a direct output of the MCMC posterior draws.
  For example, see \citet{geor:mccu:93}, \citet{carl:chib:95} and
  \citet{chib:95}.  However, this requires constructing a new MCMC
  algorithm for each application.}  Its rate of approximation is
$O(n^{-1})$, which is considerably better than easier-to-apply methods
such as Bayesian information criteria (BIC), which has a rate of only
$O(n^{-1/2})$ \citep{kass:tier:kada:89}.  For example, Kass and
Raftery (1995: 778) say that ``even for very large samples, it [BIC]
does not produce the correct value.''  Hence, in our application the
Laplace approximation is more appropriate than BIC.
