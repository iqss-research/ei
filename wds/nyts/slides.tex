\heading{Overview}
\smallskip

{\bf Illegal Ballots In Florida:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item 680 overseas absentee ballots {\it unambiguously violated} state
  election law.
\item No one has publicly disagreed with this \emph{New York Times}
  finding.
\item Other controversial aspects of the election were official and
  legal. 
\item Illegal actions resulted from {\it deliberate political
    strategies}.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

{\bf Ecological Inference With Bayesian Model Averaging:} 

\hspace{0.1in} useful when
\begin{itemize}
\item conclusions are model dependent
\item model generalization is not feasible
\item when potential critics are more partisan than academic
\end{itemize}

\begin{slide}
\heading{Invalid Overseas Absentee Ballots in Florida}
\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item 344 ballots had late, illegible or missing postmarks. \\ (postmarks
  must indicate that the ballot was cast on or before election day)
\item 183 ballots were missing United States postmarks. \\ (postmarks from
  other countries are not allowed)
\item 169 ballots were received from voters who were not registered,
  who had failed to sign the envelope, or who had not requested a
  ballot.
\item 96 ballots lacked the required signature or address of a witness
\item 19 voters cast two ballots, both of which counted.
\item 5 ballots were received after the Nov.\ 17 deadline but counted
  anyway.

{\bf Key Assumptions of King's Ecological Inference Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item Systematic differences about $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ are accounted
  for by covariates.
\item Conditional on covariates, there is no spatial correlation.
\item Conditional on covariates, $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ are independent
  of $X_i$. 
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
{\bf Difficulties of Ecological Inference}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sensitivity: Estimation results can be sensitive to model
  specification when bounds are wide.
\item Weak identifiability: We cannot include many covariates in one model.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
{\bf Particular Challenges of this Study}
\begin{itemize}
\item No strong theoretical guidance for model choice.
\item Need to build models not vulnerable to criticism from partisans.

\heading{Bayesian Model Averaging}

{\bf Data and Model:} 31 models using covariates including $X_i$,
race, sex, party registration for the absentee voters, county level
election results, and demographic variables.

{\bf Bayesian Inference:} $\P(\Delta|T) \propto \P(\Delta)\P(T|\Delta).$

{\bf Model Averaging:} 
\begin{equation*}
 \Pr(\Delta|T) = \sum_{k=1}^{31} \P(\Delta|M_k,T) \Pr(M_k|T).
\end{equation*}

{\bf Posterior Model Probability:}
\begin{itemize} 
\item The probability of the model, $k$, being true given the data.
\item Different from measures of fit like $R^2$.
\item Computed via the Bayes Theorem\begin{equation*}
\Pr(M_k|T) =  \frac{\P(T|M_k)\Pr(M_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^{31} \Pr(T|M_j) \Pr(M_j)}.

\heading{Indirect Evidence of Local Election Officials} 
\heading{Responding to Republican Pressure}
\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{New York Times} concluded ``Their [Republicans'] goal was
simple: to count the maximum number of overseas ballots in counties
won by Mr.  Bush, particularly those with a high concentration of
military voters, while seeking to disqualify overseas ballots in
counties won by Vice President Al Gore.''

\bigskip
\item The \emph{Times} claimed that as a direct result of this pressure,
``canvassing boards in about a dozen Republican-leaning counties had
reconvened for a second round of counting.  In each place,
longstanding election rules were bent and even ignored.  Boards
counted ballots postmarked as many as seven days after the election,
including some from within the United States.  They counted two
ballots sent by fax.  Officials in Santa Rosa County even counted five
ballots that arrived after the Nov.\ 17 deadline.  Again and again,
election officials crossed out the words `REJECTED AS ILLEGAL' that
had been stamped on ballot envelopes.''

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Bush won? But we will never know with certainty:} 
  
  Some scenarios show the high probability that Gore would have won.

\item {\bf Strong support for the \emph{New York Times} thesis:}

  Quantitative evidence confirms qualitative stories.

\item {\bf Validity of counterfactuals:} 
  
  Our counterfactual questions are very close to the data.
  
\item First political science application of formal Bayesian model averaging.
\item First use of Bayesian model averaging in the growing Ecological
  Inference literature.
\item An approach towards the uncertainty of model choice.
\item Model averaging cannot substitute for the investigator's
  judgment.
