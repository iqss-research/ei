\heading{Overview}
\smallskip

{\bf Illegal Ballots Found:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item 680 overseas absentee ballots violated state or federal election
  law
\item No one has publicly disagreed with this conclusion
\item Other controversial aspects of the election were litigated,
  decided, and generally accepted.  Not about voter intentions.
\item Illegal actions resulted from  deliberate political
    strategies.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

{\bf Ecological Inference With Bayesian Model Averaging:} 

\hspace{0.1in} useful when
\begin{itemize}
\item model generalization is not feasible
\item conclusions are model dependent
\item when potential critics are more partisan than academic

\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item \textcolor{Blue}{344 ballots:} late, illegible or missing
  postmarks. \\ (postmarks must indicate that the ballot was cast on
  or before election day)
\item \textcolor{Blue}{183 ballots:} U.S.\ postmarks (postmarks must 
  be from overseas).
\item \textcolor{Blue}{169 ballots:} from voters who 
  were not registered, failed to sign
  the envelope, or had not previously requested a ballot. \\ (A
  request is required by federal law).
\item \textcolor{Blue}{96 ballots:} lacked the required signature or address of a witness
\item \textcolor{Blue}{38 ballots:} 19 voters who cast two ballots each
\item \textcolor{Blue}{5 ballots:} received after the 11/17 deadline

\heading{Statistical Modeling}
\bigskip

{\bf Key Assumptions of EI}
\begin{itemize}
\item Systematic differences in $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ are accounted
  for by covariates.
\item Conditional on covariates, there is no spatial correlation.
\item Conditional on covariates, $\bb_i$ and $\bg_i$ are independent
  of $X_i$. 
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
{\bf Difficulties of Ecological Inference}
\begin{itemize}
\item Sensitivity: Estimation results can be sensitive to model
  specification when bounds are wide.
\item Weak identifiability: We cannot include many covariates in one model.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
{\bf Particular Challenges of this Study}
\begin{itemize}
\item No strong theoretical guidance for model choice.
\item Need to build models not vulnerable to criticism from partisans.
\end{itemize}

\begin{slide}
\heading{Bayesian Model Averaging}

{\bf Data and Model:} 31 models using covariates including $X_i$,
race, sex, party registration for the absentee voters, county level
election results, and demographic variables.

{\bf Bayesian Inference:} 
$\textcolor{Purple}{\P(\Delta|T,M)} \propto \P(\Delta|M)\P(T|\Delta,M).$

{\bf Model Averaging:} 
\begin{equation*}
\Pr(\Delta|T) 
 = \sum_{k=1}^{31} \textcolor{Purple}{\P(\Delta|M_k,T)} \textcolor{Red}{\Pr(M_k|T)}
\end{equation*}

\textcolor{Red}{{\bf Posterior Model Probability:}}
\begin{itemize} 
\item The probability of the model, $k$, being true given the data.
\item Different from measures of fit like $R^2$.
\item Computed via the Bayes Theorem
  \begin{equation*}
    \textcolor{Red}{\Pr(M_k|T)} 
    =  \frac{\textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\P(T|M_k)}\Pr(M_k)}{\sum_{j=1}^{31} \Pr(T|M_j) \Pr(M_j)}.  
  \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}
  \centering{\textbf{\small \color{RoyalBlue}The Marginal Likelihood}}

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The only hard part computationally:
    \begin{equation}
      \textcolor{RoyalBlue}{\P(T|M_k)} 
      = \int \P(T|\Theta_k, M_k) \P(\Theta_k|M_k) d\Theta_k,
      \label{eq:marglik}
    \end{equation} 
    
  \item Instead of the likelihood at the maximum, it is the average
    likelihood evaluated at $\Theta$ drawn from the prior.
  \item Could do by simulation, but highly inefficient.
  \item Better approximations exist.

\heading{Indirect Evidence of Local Election Officials} 
\heading{Responding to Republican Pressure}
\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item The \emph{New York Times} concluded ``Their [Republicans'] goal was
simple: to count the maximum number of overseas ballots in counties
won by Mr.  Bush, particularly those with a high concentration of
military voters, while seeking to disqualify overseas ballots in
counties won by Vice President Al Gore.''

\bigskip
\item The \emph{Times} claimed that as a direct result of this pressure,
``canvassing boards in about a dozen Republican-leaning counties had
reconvened for a second round of counting.  In each place,
longstanding election rules were bent and even ignored.  Boards
counted ballots postmarked as many as seven days after the election,
including some from within the United States.  They counted two
ballots sent by fax.  Officials in Santa Rosa County even counted five
ballots that arrived after the Nov.\ 17 deadline.  Again and again,
election officials crossed out the words `REJECTED AS ILLEGAL' that
had been stamped on ballot envelopes.''

\heading{Concluding Remarks}
\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\item Voter intentions aside, who won according to the law?  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item We will never know for certain.
  \item Bush probably won.
  \item Almost any other scenerio would probably have  led to a Gore
    victory
  \end{enumerate}
  
\item Quantitative evidence confirms qualitative stories of Republican
  pressure (which is fine) and local election officials responding
  (which is not).
  
\item Our counterfactual questions are close to the data and so easier
  to validate.
\item First political science application of formal Bayesian model averaging.
\item First use of Bayesian model averaging in the growing ecological
  inference literature.
\item An approach towards the uncertainty of model choice.
\item Model averaging cannot substitute for the investigator's
  judgment.
