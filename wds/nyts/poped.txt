Hello,

I am finally(!!) writing in response to your paper on "Did Illegally 
Counted Overseas Absentee Ballots..." that you sent to Perspectives on 
Politics.  I must start with an apology; it has taken us a ridiculously 
long time to get back to you about the disposition of this paper. The 
explanations range from the fact that the editors of _Perspectives_ were 
simply not ready to make any decisions when you first sent it (in fact, 
there were no editors except myself), to difficulty in getting the right 
reviewers, to complexities in the lives of various reviewers and 
editors. None of that explains away the length of time between 
submission and this letter, but I hope it at least conveys to you the 
fact that we were not ignoring the paper.

In fact, "Did Illegally Counted..." was the inspiration for organizing a 
symposium on the methodological and substantive lessons to be learned 
from the 2000 election. The papers for that symposium are now underway, 
and we plan to publish it in Sept. 2004 (vol 2, issue 3). Several papers 
have now been accepted, and several others are being revised before a 
final decision about acceptance.

In that context, let me turn to your paper.  The two solicited reviews 
are attached to this note; Henry Brady, who is organizing the symposium, 
served as a reader also. As you will see, the reviewers are intrigued 
with your arguments but quite skeptical about aspects of them.  In 
addition, we have concerns about how this paper should be presented in a 
journal such as Perspectives.  So the bottom line is a "revise and 
resubmit;" the rest of this note lays out our two sets of requests for 
revision before we make a final decision about publication.

First, please cut the main text of the paper by about a quarter -- down 
to about 15 pp. from the current 22 pp.  In particular, much of the 
material about Bayesian model averaging could be cut. In conjunction 
with the cuts, please do all that you can with regard to most if not all 
of the equations to say in words what is now said symbolically. One of 
the missions of Perspectives is to be accessible to all political 
scientists (and even politically sophisticated nonacademics), so the 
ideal amount of symbolic notation is zero.  If necessary, you can use 
endnotes to lay out the specifications that are absolutely essential for 
the experts; the existing appendices and any other formalizations moved 
out of the text will need to be dropped or put on the Internet (you can, 
of course, refer readers to them and provide a url, as we are doing with 
some other papers in Perspectives).

Second, there is some verbal overclaiming in the paper that needs to be 
toned down.  You'll need to back off the claim that "Formal Bayesian 
model averaging has not been used in political science..."  The 
reviewers and editors agree that the claim is not true, and in any case 
it is contradicted by footnote 7.  In addition, you'll need to 
acknowledge that you have a "too many parameters problem" and that model 
averaging does not solve the problem (unless you can conclusively refute 
this claim). It would also be valuable simply to say outright that it 
seems unlikely that of 680 invalid ballots, 537 of themn would have been 
for Bush.

The reviewers have other specific suggestions; please take them very 
seriously as you embark on revisions.  Also, as you will no doubt guess, 
Henry has worked closely with me in sorting out how to ask you to 
respond to the reviewers;let me refer you to him for any further 
discussion about revisions.  He suggested that I add one more note to 
this letter: "Personally, I think that section 4.3 is one of the most 
interesting parts of the paper, especially Table 6." Perhaps you can do 
more with it.

Again, let me express our regret that this process has taken so long -- 
you are, luckily, several standard deviations away from the next longest 
  time from submission to response.  But in the end, we are pleased with 
the symposium that is developing around the issues that your paper 
raises, and we very much hope that your paper will be able to be part of 
it.

After delaying a long time, I must now ask you to hurry with the 
revisions.  Ideally, we need to have the paper back by the first week in 
March so taht we can keep the symposium on schedule.  I hope that this 
does not cause too much of a hardship for you.

I look forward to hearing from you. best, Jennifer
