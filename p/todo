General EZI Problems

Verified, yes. If you import & then export you can lose precision, for
example

there's

Note I didn't verify that all globals actually get set.

2.a
	in particular, reading in a FMT file loads some globals like
retcode and Ghactual, and the model spec, but doesn't seem to read CONFIG
variables. 
	

2.b
Like _Eselect. Actually _Eselect is  inconstent in another way -- if you
set _Eselect to the var "foo". It reads "foo", but if then replicate the
FMT
file back in (using EIreplicate) it reads "1+". Furthermore if you don't
explicitly keep the variable you _Eselected, it can be really hard to know
what was _Eselected from the FMT file.

 Perhaps _Eselect should be treated by the UI like it was a model
parameter -- saved, and listed later.

3. The displayed built in help for the config of some variables is
wrong. The defaults listed for _EI_vc,  _EnonNumInt, and _Ecdfbvn are not
the
defaults implemented.

4. global missing from the config screen?
_EvTol

5. --- configuration screen only shows 6 decimal places and doesn't use
sci notation,   so very small tolerance values are displayed as 0.000000,
but
can't tell their real value byinspection.

6. Check whether EZI loads all globals?

7. EZI v 2.23 uses EI v. 1.62 but ships with 1the EI 1.61 version of the
manual, which
   listed different defaults.

8. If you load a dataset that has the model specifications in it already
(or use
EIREPL to get the model specifications), the CONFIG option on the main
menu still
complains that you need to specify, and won't let you in until you
actually
click on specify. 

9. In the config menu, if you use Eselect to select a variable, you can't
reset it one, unless you use the global Reset.

10. EIgraph makes you run the model first. But some graphs are data only
-- you should be able
to do those w/out running the model. 

11. If you do a nonparametric estimation only, some of the EIgraph options
will cause the
program to exit. 


12. EZI's import functionality is brain-dead:
	- although dataload works on some files (excel 3, with variable
name row)
		EZI exits on same files
	- very very very finicky on delimeters, end row return character,
	  etc. No docs to indicate exact rule.
	- some formats that dataload says it supports don't work in
dataloab (excel 2, for example)

13. For file names that fit the DOS 8.3 you can type "foo" and
"foo.fmt" is assumed,
but can not type "foofoofoo" and load "foofoofoo.fmt", instead have to
type full name.	
b
14. When EZI starts up, it displays the error "0) : error G0014
: 'C:\EZI223\startrun.GCG' : File not found"
in the Gauss window

15. If you run two instances of EZI simultaneously, things appear to work
well, but any output that you choose to "reView" gets corrupted!

EI Problems (also inherited by EZI)

- EI probably shouldn't try to compute generalized hessian when CML
return-code is non-zero. The results aren't reasonable.

- Defaults have been changed to invoke Generalized inverse right away,
rather than other quasi inverses -- this changes results significantly
across versions.

- EI manual refers to a nonexistent Appendix F for the vc and cdfbvn
globals

- EI standard errors (and CI's,etc) are supposed to be 
"very similar to, and can be interpreted analogously to, standard errors
in LR  [Linear Regression] "

Seems to contradict  King 1997, 149.

Also, one indication of bad fit/instability seems to be that the CI's are 
humongous in comparison the  std error.


- EI Repl doesn't do the right things with globals that are "new":
EI provides replication datasets which saves Global params. BUT...
	- new globals are added, and defaults for these do not
 	  necessarily match defaults of previous version. EIREPL does
	  not restore these to the implicit default of the version the
	  replication set was created in. (This would be the "Right
	Thing")
(EI repl does add warnings however, so it's not the wrong thing exactly!)

- EI docs say that you should always check fit:

"What statistical issues should I check?  It is essential to verify that
the model fits the data. First, look at eigraph's fit: for the X by T
graph on the left, verify that the E(Ti|Xi) line passes through the middle
of the points, and the 80% confidence intervals capture around 80% of the
points, vertically for each value of X on the horizontal axis."

BUT E(Ti|Xi) doesn't show up with a covariate. (Need a fit surface?)

Also -- no non-graphical FIT check. Both of these fit criteria could be
made quantitative  or more quantitative. (E.g. a count of %age of the
points falling in the 80% CI's would be useful!)

- The spikes in the log-likelihood because of switching CDFBVN methods are 
  see like a bad thing. They can be avoided with smoothing splines.
  

- EI reports time in minute starting before midnight and completing after
gives a large negative value (eg. -1434 minutes, actual time was ~ 7
minutes)


- EI2
	-- imputations assume normal (?) distribution of B's, even where
CI's show this isn't true. Moral: check the first stage CI's carefully?

- EI2 -- _Ghactual and retcode should return vector (one for each
imputation)
	instead only stores scalar value for LAST imputation. Can;t detect
	errors in intermediate ones
--
Other inconsistencies

- Gauss changed defaults in CML (used by EI and EZI0 from forward to
central derivatives,
but this can affect the solution! Also changed implementation of
CDFBVN. Unlike STATA there 
is no "version" declaration that allows a user to replicate the
settings/implementation of 
a previous version.
-  web page lists EZI version as 2.22, actually 2.23
